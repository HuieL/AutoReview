We seek to advance the state of the art by learning not only weights between neurons in the network but also part of the network structure itself \u2013 the activation functions. Current deep learning literature largely focuses on improving architectures and adding regularization to the training process.\nBy contrast, the realm of learning the network structure itself is relatively unexplored. Current best practice often treats network size, shape and choice of activation function as a hyper-parameter to be chosen empirically. Instead, we propose to learn the activation functions through nonparametric estimation. We introduce a class of nonparametric models for activation functions. Importantly, we ensure that our technique can be incorporated into the back-propagation framework. This is crucial because it means our method can be easily added to current practice. To this end, we propose learning functions via basis expansion. In particular, we find that using a Fourier basis works well in practice and offers improved performance over the baseline on several benchmark datasets. We see relative improvements in test error rates of up to 15%. Nonparametric activation functions in dropout nets are especially successful.\nWe also introduce a two-stage training process. First, a network without nonparametric activation functions is trained. Then, the learned network is used as an initialization for an identical network with nonparametric activation functions. This method of initializing the network yields considerable improvements in performance for convolution neural networks on image classification tasks.\nLastly, we consider the algorithmic stability approach to accessing generalization bounds. We use this to demonstrate that feed-forward networks with our method of nonparametrically estimating activation functions generalize well.\nTo summarize, our contributions are the following:\n\u2022 A theoretically justified framework for learning activation functions in a neural network,\n\u2022 Provable bounds on the generalization error of networks where the activation functions are learned, and\n\u2022 An optional two-stage training process that can greatly improve results for certain network architectures, specifically those with convolution layers."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORKS", "text": "Recent work from Agostinelli et al. (2015) describes piecewise linear activation functions. Theoretically speaking, our approach improves upon this by fully exploring the space of possible activation functions \u2013 not merely considering those which are piecewise linear.\nLearning activation functions, in conjunction with the weights in the layer transformations, allows for the fitting of an arbitrary function of the output of the previous layer. A similar idea is Network in Network, due to Lin et al. (2013). There the authors propose to replace standard convolution layers with what they call mlpconv layers. Traditional convolution layers, if using a sigmoid activation, are essentially learning a generalized linear model of the previous layer\u2019s output. Their innovation is to use a more general nonlinear function estimator as the filter \u2013 a multilayer perceptron. Thus, their scheme fits in the back-propagation framework and so is easy to implement. Our approach is different because though we are learning arbitrary functions of the previous layer, our activation function approach can be used in any layer of the network and in networks without convolution layers, which theirs cannot.\nMaclaurin et al. (2015) propose to learn the hyper-parameters of a neural net through reverse gradient descent. This is similar to the work we present here in that they also provide a method for learning parameters of the network."}, {"heading": "3 NONPARAMETRIC ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS", "text": "Here we describe our main contribution: the nonparametric activation function model. We also provide justification for a weight tying scheme to use nonparametric activations in conjunction with convolution layers, a regularization which proves powerful empirically (see Section 5)."}, {"heading": "3.1 FOURIER BASIS EXPANSION FOR ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS", "text": "For the nonparametric estimation we use a Fourier series basis expansion. One concern, however, with Fourier basis expansion is that function approximation over a fixed interval often exhibits poor tail behavior. To combat that, we fit the approximation over an interval [\u2212L,L] and then use it over truncation of the interval, [\u2212L+T, L+T ]. The designation NPF stands for Nonparametric Fourier Basis Expansion for Activation Functions.\nDefinition 3.1. Given some sample size n, an interval [\u2212L,L] and tail truncation T where 0 \u2264 T \u2264 L, the activation function NPF(L, T ) is parametrized by (a0, . . . , ak) and (b1, . . . , bk) given by\nf(x) =  a0 + \u2211k i=1 ai cos((\u2212L+ T )i\u03c0x/L) + bi sin((\u2212L+ T )i\u03c0x/L) x < \u2212L+ T a0 + \u2211k i=1 ai cos(i\u03c0x/L) + bi sin(i\u03c0x/L) \u2212L+ T \u2264 x \u2264 L\u2212 T\na0 + \u2211k i=1 ai cos((L\u2212 T )i\u03c0x/L) + bi sin((L\u2212 T )i\u03c0x/L) x > L\u2212 T\nk grows with sample size n and is given by k = dn1/7e.\nWe choose to present basis expansion of arbitrary functions on the interval [\u2212L,L] because it is thought to be advantageous in practice to train neural networks with activation functions that are antisymmetric through the origin (LeCun et al., 1998). Though the nonparametric activation functions learned may not be symmetric about the origin, this approach will hopefully result in them being as close to symmetric as possible.\nEach node in the fully connected layers estimates a potentially different activation function. However, in the convolution layers one activation function is learned per filter. The power of a convolution net is the weight tying scheme in the convolution layer, and we preserve that by only estimating one activation function per filter. In Section 5 the effectiveness of this approach can be seen.\nNPFC(L, T ) is the notation for the nonparametrically estimated activation functions in convolution layers. Figure 1 shows some examples of activation functions learned on the CIFAR-10 dataset."}, {"heading": "3.2 TRAINING WITH LEARNED ACTIVATION UNITS", "text": "A practical difficulty is that training nonparametric deep nets often proved unstable, specifically for networks with convolution layers. To remedy this our two-stage procedure is given as a generic description in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Generic Two Stage Training for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Input: A network architecture, hyper parameters T ,L\n1: Instantiate a network with ReLU activations in convolution layers and NPF(T, L) in all others. 2: Run training algorithm of choice. 3: Instantiate a new network with NPFC(T, L) activations in convolution layers and NPF(T, L) in\nall others. Instantiate all weights from the trained network. Instantiate NPFC(T, L) as desired. 4: Run training algorithm of choice. 5: return Network weights resulting from the second training.\nOne point that is not immediately clear is how to initialize NPF(L, T ) activation functions. A good initialization, of any parameter in the network, is crucial to the success of fitting the model. We choose to initialize them to the Fourier series approximation of the tanh function. This works quite well as will be seen in Section 5.\nAlso left to choice is how to perform both stages of training. Of particular interest is the training method used for the second stage. We explored the following two approaches:\n\u2022 In stage 2, train only the nonparametric activation functions, holding the remainder of the network constant.\n\u2022 In stage 2, train all weights in the network together.\nWe discovered that both methods are successful, but allowing for the activations and weights in the network to be trained together gave slightly better results empirically, so it is those that are reported in Section 5.\nFigure 2a shows the training path for a convolution network on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The network has three convolution layers followed by two fully connected layers. It is initially trained with rectified linear units as activations in the convolution layers and with NPF(4, 1) activations in the fully connected layers. The stage two network, instead, has NPFC(4, 1) activations in the convolution layer.\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nEpochs Trained\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nE rr\no r\nR a te\nBegin Stage Two\nTest and Training Error Rate on CIFAR-10 for Two Stage Training\nTraining Error\nTest Error\n(a) The training and testing error paths during training.

This is true for standard neural networks, and such generalization bounds are well known (for example via VC bounds (Bartlett & Anthony, 1999)). However, because we expand the function class, we can not naively apply the traditional results. Instead of the VC bound route, we take the algorithmic stability approach.\nIn recent work from Hardt et al. (2015) the authors explore a class of bounds for stochastic gradient methods. They build on the definition of stability given in Bousquet & Elisseeff (2002). Denote by f(w, z) some loss function of the output of a model, where w indicates the parameters of the learned model and z is an example from X\u00d7Y , the space of data and labels. A is an algorithm and D is the training data. Denote w = A(D) as the parameters of the model learned by the algorithm A. We take the following definition from Hardt et al. (2015).\nDefinition 4.1. An algorithm is -uniformly stable if for all data sets D,D\u2032 \u2208 (X \u00d7 Y )n such that D,D\u2032 differ in at most one example, we have\nsup z\nEA[f(A(D), z)\u2212 f(A(D\u2032), z)] \u2264 .\nThe expectation is taken with respect to any randomness present in the algorithm itself. By stab(A,n) be the infimum over all for which the statement holds.\nBoth Bousquet & Elisseeff (2002); Hardt et al. (2015) present Theorem 4.2 regarding the generalization ability of -uniformly stable algorithms is given\nTheorem 4.2. Take some algorithm -uniformly stable algorithm A. Then |ED,A[RD[A(D)]\u2212R[A(D)]]| \u2264 .\nThe notation RD[w] signifies the empirical risk when the loss function depends on w in addition to z. Likewise for the notation RD[A(D)]. Lastly, we have Theorem 4.5 also from Hardt et al. (2015) that will allow us to derive a generalization bound for our model trained with stochastic gradient descent.\nDefinition 4.3. A function f is L-Lipschitz if for all points u, v \u2208 dom(f), |f(u)\u2212 f(v)| \u2264 L||u\u2212 v||.\nDefinition 4.4. A function f : \u2126\u2192 R is \u03b2-smooth if for all u, v \u2208 \u2126, ||\u2207f(u)\u2212\u2207f(v)|| \u2264 \u03b2||u\u2212 v||.\nTheorem 4.5. Assume that f(,\u0307z) \u2208 [0, 1] is an L\u2212Lipschitz and \u03b2-smooth loss function for every z. Suppose that we run SGM for T steps with monotonically non increasing step sizes \u03b1t \u2264 c/t. Then SGM has uniform stability with\nstab \u2264 1 + 1/\u03b2c\nn\u2212 1 (2cL2)\n1 \u03b2c+1T \u03b2c \u03b2c+1 .\nIn particular, up to some constant factors, the following relationship approximately holds\nstab \u2264 T 1\u22121/(\u03b2c+1)\nn .\n(Hardt et al., 2015)\nIn order to apply the theorem, we demonstrate our network architecture and choice of loss function meets this requirement. Once -stability is established, generalization follows by Theorem 4.2.\n4.1 FEED-FORWARD NETWORKS WITH NPF(T, L) ACTIVATIONS\nFor the full proofs of results in this section, see Appendix A. Assume a network architecture of Q fully connected hidden layers (affine transformation layers) fed into a softmax layer which classifies into one of c classes. The weight vector for the network w should be viewed as the all parameters of the affine transformations and activation functions.\nThe loss function is the negative log-likelihood of the network output, which is a softmax over c classes. We treat the softmax layer as two layers for the purposes of demonstrating the generalization\nbound. One layer is an affine transformation of the output of the lower layers in the network to c nodes. We will denote the result of this computation at each node i in the affine transformation layer within the softmax layer as gQ+1(w, x)i. The second layer maps the outputs at these c nodes to c nodes \u2013 this will be the network output. It computes at the the ith node\noi(w, x) = exp gQ+1(w, x)i\u2211c i=1 exp gQ+1(w, x)i .\nThus, on some training example (x, y), the negative log-likelihood of the network output is\nf(w, (x, y)) = \u2212 log(oi(w, x)) = \u2212gQ+1(w, x)y + log ( c\u2211 i=1 exp gQ+1(w, x)c ) .\nIf we can demonstrate that this f has the desired properties, then the generalization bound given in Section 4 will apply.\nOne point to note is that in order to control the gradients of the various transformations in the layers in the network, we need to control the norm of the weight matrices W and biases b in the affine layers and the coefficients of the activations NPF(L, T ). This is a common technique and is compatible with the framework in Hardt et al. (2015), as it only makes updates less expansive. Note that though f does not have range [0, 1], it is bounded due to the max-norm constraints and can be rescaled. Some smoothing is assumed in order achieve the bound, but in practice the smoothing is not a concern as it can be assumed to take place in an -neighborhood of the transition from one piece of the activation function to another. The smoothed nonparametric activation functions are denoted NPF (L, T ). Recall that k = dn1/7e. Theorem 4.6. Consider a fully connected network with a softmax output layer and NPF (L, T ) activation functions. Assume we use SGD with a max-norm constraint on the weight matrix and biases in the affine layers and on the coefficients of the activation functions to train the network. Then there exists some K such that the loss function as given in Section 4.1 is K-Lipschitz. Specifically, for any such network where the number of hidden layers Q \u2265 1 and there are p nodes per layer,\nK = max { O (\u221a Q(pQ+1k3Q+p(2Q+1)/2k3Q\u22121L) Q ) ,O (\u221a Q(pQ+1k3Q+p(2Q+1)/2k3Q\u22121L) QLQ )} .\nProof. The full proof is in Appendix A. The proof idea is to bound the first partial derivatives of the loss function f with respect to each parameter in the network. Then we can proceed recursively down through the network to obtain a bound. From there the gradient can be bounded, implying the loss function f is Lipschitz.\nTheorem 4.7. Consider a fully connected network with a softmax output layer and NPF (L, T ) activation functions. Assume we use SGD with a max-norm constraint on the weight matrix and biases in the affine layers and on the coefficients of the activation functions to train the network. Then there exists some K such that the loss function as given in Section 4.1 is \u03b2-smooth. Specifically, for any such network where the number of hidden layers Q \u2265 1 and there are p nodes per layer,\n\u03b2 = max { O ( Q p3Q+5/2k9Q\u22122\nL2Q 3Q\u22121\n) ,O ( Q p2 Q+Q+2k5\u00d72 Q+3QL2 Q\u22121+1\n2Q+Q\n)} .\nProof. The full proof is in Appendix A. The proof idea is to bound the second partial derivatives of f with respect to each of the parameters in the network. Then we can bound |\u03bbmax(\u22072f)| and thus the largest singular value. This gives an upper bound of \u03b2 on ||\u22072f ||2, implying f is \u03b2-smooth.\nTheorem 4.8. Consider a fully connected network with a softmax output layer and NPF (L, T ) activation functions. Assume we use SGD with a max-norm constraint on the weight matrix and biases in the affine layers and on the coefficients of the activation functions to train the network. Then, for all practical values of L,T , ,Q and p, the resulting Lipschitz constant K and smoothness constant \u03b2 are sufficiently large that\nstab \u2264 T\nn\u2212 1 .\nThus if T = O( \u221a n), stab \u2192 0 as sample size n\u2192\u221e.\nProof.

Specifically, for the standard neural networks we use networks with three fully connected hidden layers with 2048 units in each layer fed into a 10-way softmax.\nThe convolutional neural networks in these experiments have two convolutional layers with 32 and 64 filters respectively. Filters are 5 \u00d7 5 and these layers are followed by a max pooling layer with 2\u00d72 pool size. The feed-forward networks consist of 3 fully connected layers with 2048 units each.

We achieve relative improvements in performance of up to 15% and absolute improvements of up to 1.3% on two benchmark datasets. Equally importantly, networks with the activation functions NPF(L, T ) and NPFC(L, T ) can be trained as fast as their baseline comparison. To realize these improvements on more challenging datasets such as CIFAR-10 we introduced a two-stage training procedure. Our nonparametric activation functions are principled in that they have the necessary properties to guarantee vanishing generalization error in the sense of Bousquet & Elisseeff (2002). Specifically, it was shown in Theorem 4.8, from Section 4.1, that for any feed-forward network architecture using NPF(L, T ) activation functions, we achieve vanishing generalization error as sample size increases.\nOne interesting direction for future work is to investigate why Fourier basis expansion is successful where other methods, such as polynomial basis expansion (which we also explored), were not. Both can be theoretically justified, yet only one works well in practice. Further study of how to eliminate the two-stage process is needed.\nUltimately, we improve upon other approaches of expanding the function class which can be learned by deep neural networks. An important previous work on learning more general function approximations at each node is that of Lin et al. (2013). Their result offers a new type of convolution filter that can learn a broader function class, and in practice their technique also works well. It is limited however in that its use is restricted to convolution layers in convolution neural networks.

The weight vector for the network w should be viewed as the all parameters of the affine transformations and activation functions.\nThe loss function is the negative log-likelihood of the network output, which is a softmax over c classes. The softmax layer in our framework should be treated as two layers for the purposes of demonstrating the generalization bound. One layer is an affine transformation of the output of the lower layers in the network to c nodes.

In addition, we also need to control the magnitude of the coefficients in the basis expansion. This does not affect the applicability of the results from Hardt et al. (2015), as it at most reduces the expansivity of the updates.\nFurthermore, for the analysis of their properties we assume a slightly modified version of the activation functions \u2013 in an epsilon neighborhood about the points where the pieces of the function connect we smooth their joint by taking a convex combination of the two pieces to smoothly transition from one to the other. To this end define the following functions\nL(x) = a0 + k\u2211 i=1 ai cos((\u2212L+ T )i\u03c0/L) + bi sin((\u2212L+ T )i\u03c0/L),\nM(x) = a0 + k\u2211 i=1 ai cos(i\u03c0x/L) + bi sin(i\u03c0x/L),\nU(x) = a0 + k\u2211 i=1 ai cos((L\u2212 T )i\u03c0/L) + bi sin((L\u2212 T )i\u03c0/L).\nfor given L, T, k, (a0, . . . , ak), and (b1, . . . , bk). Then the -neighborhood smoothed nonparametric activation functions are given by Definition A.2.\nDefinition A.2. Given some sample size n, an interval [\u2212L,L] and tail truncation T where 0 \u2264 T \u2264 L, the activation function NPF (L, T ) is parametrized by (a0, . . . , ak) and (b1, . . . , bk) given by\nf(x) =  L(x) x < \u2212L+ T \u2212 [Case 1] x+L\u2212T+ 2 M(x) + \u2212L+T+ \u2212x 2 L(x) \u2212L+ T \u2212 \u2264 x \u2264 \u2212L+ T + [Case 2] M(x) \u2212L+ T + \u2264 x \u2264 L\u2212 T \u2212 [Case 3] L\u2212T+ \u2212x 2 M(x) + x\u2212L+T+\n2 U(x) L\u2212 T \u2212 \u2264 x \u2264 L\u2212 T + [Case 4] U(x) x > L\u2212 T + [Case 5]\nk grows with sample size n and is given by k = dn1/7e.\nSince we are concerned with behavior as is made small \u2013 because we are approximating NPF(T, L) with NPF (T, L) \u2013 assume without loss of generality that \u2264 1.\nA.1 LIPSCHITZ CONSTANT\nWe proceed layer by layer to obtain bounds on the first partial derivatives of the loss function \u2013 which will allow us to bound the gradient. Lemma A.3 gives bounds for the first layer. The notation a(w, x) denotes the output of a layer-wide activation transformation. g(w, x) denotes the output of a layer-wide affine transformation.\nLemma A.3. Assume x \u2208 [\u2212a, a]m. Now, consider the affine transformation g1(w) = W1x + b1 from Rm \u2192 Rp, thus W1 \u2208 Rm\u00d7p and b \u2208 Rp. Denoting by g1(w, x)i = W1,ix + b1,i, it follows that g1 has first partial derivatives bounded by max{1, a}.\nProof. Clearly,\u2207g1(w, x)i = [1, . . . , 1;x; 0, . . . , 0]. Thus it has first partial derivatives bounded by max{1, a}.\nWhat if we have instead as input to the affine transformation a function of x rather than x itself? Then we have the Lemma A.4.\nLemma A.4. Let ai\u22121(w, x) \u2208 [\u2212a, a]pi\u22121 , the output of the (i \u2212 1)th layer in the network. Now, consider the affine transformation\ngi(w, x) = Wiai\u22121(w, x) + bi.\nfrom Rpi\u22121 \u2192 Rpi . bi \u2208 Rd. If we have the following assumptions:\n\u2022 ai(w, x)q has first partial derivatives bounded by B, and\n\u2022 ||Wi,j ||2 \u2264 N .\nDenoting by gi(w, x)j = Wi,jai\u22121(w, x) + bi,j , it follows that gi(w, x)j has first partial derivatives bounded by max{1, a, \u221a nNL}.\nProof. We need to first examine\n\u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202bi,j = \u2202bi,j \u2202bi,j + \u2202 \u2202bi,j ( n\u2211 q=1 Wi,j,qai\u22121(w, x)q ) = 1 + 0 = 1.\nNext we have for any m,\n\u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202Wi,j,m = \u2202bi,j \u2202Wi,j,m +\n\u2202\n\u2202Wi,j,m ( n\u2211 q=1 Wi,j,qai\u22121(w, x)q )\n= 0 + ai\u22121(w, x)m + \u2211 q 6=m Wi,j,q \u2202ai\u22121(w, x)q \u2202Wi,j,m\n= ai\u22121(w, x)m.\nPartial derivatives with respect to all other parameters from the ith layer are clearly 0. If l > i, partial derivatives with respect to all parameters from the lth layer are clearly 0. If l < i,\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202gi(w, x)j\u2202Wl,m,q \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2202bi,j\u2202Wl,m,q + \u2202\u2202Wl,m,q ( pi\u22121\u2211 r=1 Wi,j,rai\u22121(w, x)r )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22230 + pi\u22121\u2211 r=1 Wi,j,r \u2202ai\u22121(w, x)r \u2202Wl,m,q \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 N\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221api\u22121\u2211 r=1 ( \u2202ai\u22121(w, x)r \u2202Wl,m,q )2 (Cauchy-Schwartz)\n\u2264 \u221api\u22121NB. Likewise,\n|\u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202bl,q | \u2264 \u221api\u22121NB\nand for the partial derivatives with respect to activation function parameters. It follows that the transformations gi(w, x)j have first partial derivatives bounded by max{1, a, \u221a pi\u22121NB}.\nLemma A.5 provides a bound on the range of affine transformations of outputs of NPF (T, L) activations.\nLemma A.5. Consider the affine transformation in layer i, gi(w, x). Assume\n\u2022 All layers in the network have NPF (L, T ) activations and that coefficients in these activations are bounded by M ,\n\u2022 For all i and j, ||Wi,j ||2 \u2264 N , and\n\u2022 For all i and j, |bi,j | \u2264 O.\nThen, for all j, |gi(w, x)j | \u2264 \u221a pi\u22121(2k + 1)NM +O = O( \u221a pi\u22121k).\nProof. Recall that gi(w, x)j = Wi,jai\u22121(w, x)+bi,j , thus by Cauchy-Schwartz and that im(sin) = im(cos) = [\u22121, 1],\n|gi(w, x)j | \u2264 \u221a pi\u22121(2k + 1)NM +O = O( \u221a pi\u22121k).\nNext, we bound the component functions of NPF (L, T ). In addition, to derive asymptotic bounds, we assume N ,M , and O are constants as they are part of the training procedure and not the network structure. We are more concerned with how the smoothness and continuity properties change as n,k,L,T ,Q and pi change. Also note that for the activation function NPF (L, T ) to be well defined, it must be that \u2264 L. We also assume \u2264 1. Lemma A.6. Assume gi(w, x) \u2208 [\u2212a, a]pi and that gi(w, x)j has first partial derivatives bounded by B. Further assume that |ad| \u2264 M and define f(w, x) = ad cos ( d\u03c0gi(w,x)j\nL\n) . Then f(w, x) has\nfirst partial derivatives bounded by max{d\u03c0MBL , 1}.\nProof. Taking the derivative of f with respect to ad yields\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2202f\u2202ad \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223cos(d\u03c0gi(w, x)jL )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 1. Next if we take the derivative of f with respect to any weight from elsewhere in the network \u2013 some z \u2013 we get\n\u2202f \u2202z = \u2212d\u03c0ad L \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202z sin\n( d\u03c0gi(w, x)j\nL\n) ,\nand therefore that \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202f\u2202z \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223d\u03c0adL \u2202gi(w, x)j\u2202z \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 d\u03c0MBL , and so the partial derivatives of f are bounded by max{d\u03c0MBL , 1}.\nImmediately from the proof to Lemma A.6 we see that an identical result holds if we replaced cos with sin.\nLemma A.7. Let gi(w, x) \u2208 [\u2212a, a]pi\u22121 and assume\n\u2022 gi(w, x)j has first partial derivatives bounded by B,\n\u2022 All layers in the network have NPF (L, T ) activations and that coefficients in these activations are bounded by M ,\n\u2022 For all i and j, ||Wi,j ||2 \u2264 N , and\n\u2022 For all i and j, |bi,j | \u2264 O.\nConsider the layer-wide activation transformation ai(w, x) where ai(w, x)j is given by a function of the type NPF (L, T ). ai(w, x)j then has first partial derivatives with bound\nB\u2032 = O ( max {\u221a pi\u22121k 3B + k2L\nL ,\n\u221a pi\u22121k 3B + k2L }) .\nProof. To bound the partial derivatives, first consider Cases 1 and 5, clearly the derivative with respect to some parameter z is 0. For Case 3, by Lemma A.6,\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202M(gi(w, x)j)\u2202z \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 (k2 + k)MB\u03c0L + (k2 + k) = (k2 + k)(MB + L)\u03c0L = O ( k2 + k2B L ) .\nNext consider Case 2, we have \u2202\n\u2202z\n( gi(w, x)j + L\u2212 T +\n2 M(gi(w, x)j) + \u2212L+ T + \u2212 gi(w, x)j 2 L(gi(w, x)j) ) = \u2202\n\u2202z\n( gi(w, x)j + L\u2212 T +\n2 M(gi(w, x)j)\n) \u2212 \u2202gi(w, x)j\n\u2202z\n1\n2 L(gi(w, x)j)\n= 1\n2 \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202z M(gi(w, x)j) +\n( gi(w, x)j + L\u2212 T +\n2\n) \u2202M(gi(w, x)j)\n\u2202z \u2212 \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202z 1 2 L(gi(w, x)j)\n=\n( M(gi(w, x)j)\u2212 L(gi(w, x)j)\n2\n) \u2202gi(w, x)j\n\u2202z +\n( gi(w, x)j + L\u2212 T +\n2\n) \u2202M(gi(w, x)j)\n\u2202z .\nBoth M(x) and L(x) are trivially bounded above by (k2 + k + 1)M . Therefore\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2202\u2202z ( gi(w, x)j + L\u2212 T + 2 M(gi(w, x)j) + \u2212L+ T + \u2212 gi(w, x)j 2 L(gi(w, x)j) )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223(M(gi(w, x)j)\u2212 L(gi(w, x)j)2 ) \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202z + ( gi(w, x)j + L\u2212 T + 2 ) \u2202M(gi(w, x)j) \u2202z\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 (k 2 + k + 1)BM + (\u221a pi\u22121(2k + 1)NM +O + L+\n2\n)( (k2 + k)(MB + L)\u03c0\nL ) = O ( max {\u221a pi\u22121k 3B + k2L\nL ,\n\u221a pi\u22121k 3B + k2L }) .\nBy symmetry, we have the same bound for Case 4. Thus overall, the bound on the first partial derivatives of ai(w, x)j is\nO(max {\u221a pi\u22121k 3B + k2L\nL ,\n\u221a pi\u22121k 3B + k2L } ),\nas for all values of k,B,L, and pi\u22121 the bound for Cases 2 and 4 dominates the bound for Case 3.\nFinally, we turn to the top layer of the network.\nLemma A.8. With the notation established in Section A, assume there are c classes, the network has Q layers of affine transformations, and each gL(w, x)j has first partial derivatives bounded by B. Then the loss function f is 2B \u221a (pl + 1)c+ \u2211Q i=1 pi(pi\u22121 + 1)\u2212Lipschitz. If all layers have\np nodes, then f is 2B \u221a\n(Q\u2212 1)p2 + (c+m+Q)p+ c-Lipschitz. In asymptotic notation, it is K-Lipschitz with K = O(Bp \u221a Q).\nProof. Consider the partial derivative of f with respect to an arbitrary parameter z\n\u2202f \u2202z = \u2202gL(w, x)y \u2202z + 1\u2211c j=1 exp(gL(w, x)j) c\u2211 j=1 \u2202gL(w, x)j \u2202z exp(gL(w, x)j).\nBy the assumption |\u2202gL(w,x)y\u2202z | \u2264 Q. Therefore the following holds\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202f\u2202z \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202gL(w, x)y\u2202z + 1\u2211cj=1 exp(gL(w, x)j) c\u2211 j=1 \u2202gL(w, x)j \u2202z exp(gj) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202gL(w, x)y\u2202z \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223+ \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1\u2211cj=1 exp(gL(w, x)j) k\u2211 j=1 \u2202gL(w, x)j \u2202z exp(gL(w, x)j)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 B + \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223maxj \u2202gL(w, x)j\u2202z \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2264 2B. If layer i has pi nodes there are pi \u00d7 pi\u22121 + pi = pi(pi\u22121 + 1) parameters corresponding to the affine transformation from layer i \u2212 1 to layer i. Recall layer 0 is the input layer, so p0 = m.\nFurthermore, the affine transformation in the softmax has pl \u00d7 c + c parameters. Thus the total number of parameters in the network is\n(pl + 1)c+ Q\u2211 i=1 pi(pi\u22121 + 1),\nwhich implies that f is 2B \u221a (pl + 1)c+ \u2211Q i=1 pi(pi\u22121 + 1)\u2212Lipschitz. If all layers have the same number of nodes, then the total number of parameters in the network is (Q\u2212 1)p2 + (c+m+Q)p+ c\nand so in this case f is 2B \u221a\n(Q\u2212 1)p2 + (c+m+Q)p+ c-Lipschitz. In asymptotic notation, it is K-Lipschitz with K = O(Bp \u221a Q).\nCombining all the results above we have Theorem A.9.\nTheorem A.9. Consider a fully connected network with a softmax output layer and NPF (L, T ) activation functions. Assume we use SGD with a max-norm constraint on the weight matrix and biases in the affine layers and on the coefficients of the activation functions to train the network. Then there exists some K such that the loss function as given in Section A is K-Lipschitz. Specifically, for any such network, where the number of hidden layers Q \u2265 1 and there are p nodes per layer,\nK = max { O (\u221a Q(pQ+1k3Q + p(2Q+1)/2k3Q\u22121L)\nQ\n) ,O (\u221a Q(pQ+1k3Q + p(2Q+1)/2k3Q\u22121L)\nQLQ\n)} .\nProof. By Lemmas A.3, A.4, A.7 and A.8 such an K must exist. Note that the output of a NPF (T, L) activation is in [\u2212(k2 +k+ 1)N, (k2 +k+ 1)N ]. Then, the computation is as follows, using the aforementioned theorems:\n\u2022 g1 \u2013 B = 1 \u2022 a1 \u2013 B = max { O (\u221a pk3+k2L ) ,O (\u221a pk3+k2L\nL )} \u2022 g2 \u2013 B = max { O ( pk3+ \u221a pk2L ) ,O ( pk3+ \u221a pk2L\nL )} \u2022 a2 \u2013 B = max { O ( p3/2k6+pk5L 2 ) ,O ( p3/2k6+pk5L\n2L2 )} \u2022 g3 \u2013 B = max { O ( p2k6+p3/2k5L 2 ) ,O ( p2k6+p3/2k5L\n2L2 )} \u2022 a3 \u2013 B = max { O ( p5/2k9+p2k8L 3 ) ,O ( p5/2k9+p2k8L\n3L3 )} Above the transformations are listed with the bounds on their first partial derivatives. A simple inductive argument yields for i \u2265 2\n\u2022 gi \u2013\nB = max { O ( pi\u22121k3(i\u22121) + p(2i\u22123)/2k3i\u22124L\ni\u22121\n) ,O ( pi\u22121k3(i\u22121) + p(2i\u22123)/2k3i\u22124L\ni\u22121Li\u22121 )} \u2022 ai \u2013\nB = max { O ( p(2i\u22121)/2k3i + pi\u22121k3i\u22121\ni\n) ,O ( p(2i\u22121)/2k3i + pi\u22121k3i\u22121\niLi )} Using Lemma A.8 gives\nK = max { O (\u221a Q(pQ+1k3Q + p(2Q+1)/2k3Q\u22121L)\nQ\n) ,O (\u221a Q(pQ+1k3Q + p(2Q+1)/2k3Q\u22121L)\nQLQ\n)} .\nconcluding the proof.\nA.2 \u03b2-SMOOTHNESS\nTo derive the smoothness constant, we begin at the top of the network and work down, bounding partial second derivatives of transformations in the network. Lemma A.10. With the notation established in Section A, assume there are c classes and each gj has first partial derivatives bounded by B1 and second partial derivatives bounded by B2. Then the loss function f is 2((pl + 1)c+ \u2211Q i=1 pi(pi\u22121 + 1))(B 2 1 +B2)-smooth. If all layers have p nodes, then f is 2((Q\u2212 1)p2 + (c+m+Q)p+ c)(B21 +B2)-smooth.\nProof. We begin by recalling from the proof of Lemma A.8 that for some arbitrary parameter z,\n\u2202f \u2202z = \u2202gL(w, x)y \u2202z + 1\u2211c l=1 exp(gj) c\u2211 l=1 \u2202gL(w, x)l \u2202z exp(gL(w, x)l).\nTherefore differentiating again with respect to another parameter x yields\n\u22022f \u2202z\u2202x = \u22022gL(w, x)y \u2202z\u2202x \u2212 [ c\u2211 l=1 \u2202gL(w, x)l \u2202z exp(gL(w, x)l) ][ c\u2211 l=1 \u2202gL(w, x)l \u2202x exp(gL(w, x)l) ] \u00d7\n[ c\u2211 l=1 exp(gL(w, x)l) ]\u22122 + [ c\u2211 l=1 ( \u22022gL(w, x)l \u2202z\u2202x + \u2202gL(w, x)l \u2202z \u2202gL(w, x)l \u2202x ) exp(gL(w, x)l) ] \u00d7\n[ c\u2211 l=1 exp(gL(w, x)l) ]\u22121 .\nIf we take the absolute value of both sides we can see that\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u22022f\u2202z\u2202x \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 2B21 + 2B2.\nAnd therefore by Theorem C.2 it follows that\n|\u03bbmax(\u22072f)| \u2264 2((pl + 1)c+ Q\u2211 i=1 pi(pi\u22121 + 1))(B 2 1 +B2).\nBecause\u22072f is symmetric, its singular values are just the absolute values of its eigenvalues. Therefore ||\u22072f ||2 \u2264 2n(B21 + B2). By Lemma D.2, we have that f is 2(2(pl + 1)c+ \u2211Q i=1 pi(pi\u22121 + 1))(B21 +B2)-smooth. If all layers have the same number of nodes, then |\u03bbmax(\u22072f)| \u2264 2((Q\u2212 1)p2 + (c+m+Q)p+ c)(B21 +B2) and so f is 2((Q\u2212 1)p2 + (c+m+Q)p+ c)(B21 +B2)-smooth.\nNext, it is necessary to control the second partial derivatives of the affine transformations as the first derivatives are bounded in Lemma A.4. This leads to Lemma A.11. Lemma A.11. Let ai\u22121(w, x) \u2208 [\u2212a, a]pi\u22121 , the output of the (i\u2212 1)th layer in the network. Now, consider the affine transformation\ngi(w, x) = Wiai\u22121(w, x) + bi,\nfrom Rpi\u22121 \u2192 Rpi . bi \u2208 Rd. If we have the following assumptions:\n\u2022 ai(w, x)q has first partial derivatives bounded by B1,\n\u2022 ai(w, x)q has second partial derivatives bounded by B2, and\n\u2022 ||Wi,j ||2 \u2264 N .\nDenoting by gi(w, x)j = Wi,jai\u22121(w, x) + bi,j , it follows that gi(w, x)j has second partial derivatives bounded by max{B1, N \u221a pi\u22121B2}.\nProof. From the proof of Lemma A.4 we have that \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202bi,j = 1\nand for any m \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202Wi,j,m = ai\u22121(w, x)m.\nFor some m 6= j and any q, \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202Wi,m,q = 0.\nAnd, lastly, that the partial derivatives with respect to any parameter z in layer l < i\n\u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202z = pi\u22121\u2211 q=1 Wi,j,q \u2202ai\u22121(w, x)q \u2202z .\nWe see then that for the first and third cases the second partial derivatives are zero. For the second case above, the second partial derivatives are either 0 or bounded by B1. What remains then is to check the fourth case. If we differentiate with respect to bi,j ,\n\u22022gi(w, x)j \u2202z\u2202bi,j = 0.\nIf we differentiate with respect to Wi,m,q , for m 6= j, \u22022gi(w, x)j \u2202z\u2202Wi,m,q = 0.\nIf we differentiate with respect to Wi,j,q , \u22022gi(w, x)j \u2202z\u2202Wi,j,q = \u2202ai\u22121(w, x)q \u2202z . Thus the only remaining case is if we differentiate with respect to some parameter z\u2032 from a layer l < i:\n\u22022gi(w, x)j \u2202z\u2202z\u2032 = pi\u22121\u2211 q=1 \u2202 \u2202z\u2032 ( Wi,j,q \u2202ai\u22121(w, x)q \u2202z )\n= pi\u22121\u2211 q=1 Wi,j,q \u22022ai\u22121(w, x)q \u2202z\u2202z\u2032 .\nIf we take the absolute value of both sides we get that\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22022gi(w, x)j\u2202z\u2202z\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 pi\u22121\u2211 q=1 Wi,j,q \u22022ai\u22121(w, x)q \u2202z\u2202z\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 N\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221api\u22121\u2211 q=1 ( \u22022ai\u22121(w, x)q \u2202z\u2202z\u2032 )2 (Cauchy-Schwartz)\n\u2264 N\u221api\u22121B2 And therefore gi(w, x)j has second partial derivatives bounded by max{B1, N \u221a pi\u22121B2}.\nWe also consider affine transformations on the input \u2013 although this is covered by Lemma A.11, we can obtain a better bound directly.\nLemma A.12. Assume x \u2208 [\u2212a, a]m. Now, consider the affine transformation g1(w) = W1x+ b1 from Rm \u2192 Rp, thus W1 \u2208 Rm\u00d7p and b \u2208 Rp. Denoting by g1(w, x)i = W1,ix + b1,i, it follows that g1 has second partial derivatives bounded by 0.\nProof. Recall that from the proof of Lemma A.3 \u2207g1(w, x)i = [1, . . . , 1;x; 0, . . . , 0]. Thus its second derivatives are all 0.\nFinally, a bound is needed for the second partial derivatives of the NPF (L, T ) activations.\nLemma A.13. Assume gi(w, x) \u2208 [\u2212a, a]pi and that gi(w, x)j has first partial derivatives bounded by B1 and second partial derivatives bounded by B2. Further assume that |ad| \u2264 M and define f(w, x) = ad cos ( d\u03c0gi(w,x)j\nL\n) . Then f(w, x) has second partial derivatives bounded by\nmax { d\u03c0MLB2+d\n2\u03c02MB21 L2 , d\u03c0B1 L\n} .\nProof. Recall from the proof of Lemma A.6 that taking the derivative of f(w, x) with respect to ad yields\n\u2202f(w, x)\n\u2202ad = cos\n( d\u03c0gi(w, x)j\nL\n) ,\nand that if we take the derivative of f(w, x) with respect to any weight from elsewhere in the network \u2013 some z \u2013 we get\n\u2202f(w, x) \u2202z = \u2212d\u03c0ad L \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202z sin\n( d\u03c0gi(w, x)j\nL ) Now, if we take the derivative of \u2202f(w,x)\u2202ad with respect to ad we get 0. If we take the derivative of \u2202f(w,x) \u2202ad with respect to some z we get\n\u22022f(w, x)\n\u2202ad\u2202z = \u2212 sin\n( d\u03c0gi(w, x)j\nL\n)( d\u03c0\nL \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202z ) and we can bound this as \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22022f(w, x)\u2202ad\u2202z\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 d\u03c0B1L . Next if we take the derivative of \u2202f(w,x)\u2202z with respect to ad we get the same as above. Lastly we take the derivative of \u2202f(w,x)\u2202z with respect to some z \u2032 which gives \u22022f(w, x)\n\u2202z\u2202z\u2032 = \u2212d\u03c0ad L \u22022gi(w, x)j \u2202z\u2202z\u2032 sin\n( d\u03c0gi(w, x)j\nL\n) \u2212d\n2\u03c02ad L2 \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202z \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202z\u2032 cos\n( d\u03c0gi(w, x)j\nL\n) ,\nwhich we can bound as\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22022f(w, x)\u2202z\u2202z\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 d\u03c0MB2L + d2\u03c02MB21L2 = d\u03c0MLB2 + d2\u03c02MB21L2 .\nTherefore the second partial derivatives of f are bounded by max { d\u03c0MLB2+d\n2\u03c02MB21 L2 , d\u03c0B1 L\n} .\nLemma A.14. Let gi(w, x) \u2208 [\u2212a, a]pi\u22121 and assume\n\u2022 gi(w, x)j has first partial derivatives bounded by B1,\n\u2022 gi(w, x)j has first partial derivatives bounded by B2,\n\u2022 All layers in the network have NPF (L, T ) activations and that coefficients in these activations are bounded by M ,\n\u2022 For all i and j, ||Wi,j ||2 \u2264 N , and\n\u2022 For all i and j, |bi,j | \u2264 O.\nConsider the layer-wide activation transformation ai(w, x) where ai(w, x)j is given by a function of the type NPF (L, T ). ai(w, x)j then has second partial derivatives bounded by\nB\u2032 = O ( B22k 2 + B1k 2 + \u221a pi\u22121k 3(B1 +B2)\nL + k4B21 L2 + k3B21 L\n) .\nProof. Without loss of generality we can assume that if Bi 6= 0 that Bi \u2265 1, as these are upper bounds. To bound the second partial derivatives, first note that Cases 1 and 5 have partial second\nderivatives of 0 with respect to all parameters in the network. Next, in Case 3 we see from Lemma A.13 that\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22022M(gi(w, x)j)\u2202z\u2202z\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 2 k\u2211 d=1 ( d\u03c0MLB2 + d 2\u03c02MB21 L2 + d\u03c0B1 L ) =\n(k2 + k)\u03c0MLB2 L2 +\n( k3\n3 + k2 2 + k 6 ) \u03c02MB21 L2 + (k2 + k)\u03c0B1 L\n= O ( k2(B1 +B2)\nL + k3B21 L2 ) for any two parameters z and z\u2032. Denote\nc1 = L\u2212 T + and c2 = \u2212L+ T + . In Case 5 then, we can compute\n\u22022ai(w, x)j \u2202z\u2202z\u2032 = \u2202 \u2202z\u2032\n( \u2202gi(w, x)j\n\u2202z\u2032 M(gi(w, x)j) 2 + \u2202M(gi(w, x)j) \u2202z\u2032 gi(w, x)j + c1 2\n\u2212\u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202z\u2032 L(gi(w, x)j) 2 ) = \u22022gi(w, x)j \u2202z\u2202z\u2032 M(gi(w, x)j) 2 + \u2202gi(w, x)j \u2202z\u2032 \u2202M(gi(w, x)j) \u2202z 1 2\n+ \u2202gi(w, x)j\n\u2202z\n\u2202M(gi(w, x)j) \u2202z\u2032 1 2 + \u22022M(gi(w, x)j) \u2202z\u2202z\u2032 gi(w, x)j + c1 2\n\u2212 \u2202 2gi(w, x)j \u2202z\u2202z\u2032 L(gi(w, x)j)\n2 and then bound it, using B3 and B4 as bounds on the first and second partial derivatives of M , respectively,\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22022ai(w, x)j\u2202z\u2202z\u2032\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 B22 (k2 + k + 1)M + B1B3 +B4 a+ c12 = O ( B22k 2 + B1k 2 + \u221a pi\u22121k 3(B1 +B2)\nL + k4B21 L2 + k3B21 L + k2(B1 +B2) L\n+ k3B21 L2 ) = O ( B22k 2 + B1k 2 + \u221a pi\u22121k 3(B1 +B2)\nL + k4B21 L2 + k3B21 L\n) .\nSince this bound dominates the one for Case 3, we are done.\nCombining all the results above we have Theorem A.15. Theorem A.15. Consider a fully connected network with a softmax output layer and NPF (L, T ) activation functions. Assume we use SGD with a max-norm constraint on the weight matrix and biases in the affine layers and on the coefficients of the activation functions to train the network. Then there exists someK such that the loss function as given in Section A is \u03b2-smooth. Specifically, for any such network where the number of hidden layers Q \u2265 1 and and there are p nodes per layer,\n\u03b2 = max { O ( Q p3Q+5/2k9Q\u22122\nL2Q 3Q\u22121\n) ,O ( Q p2 Q+Q+2k5\u00d72 Q+3QL2 Q\u22121+1\n2Q+Q\n)} .\nProof. By Lemmas A.3, A.4, A.7, A.10, A.11, A.14 and A.12 such a \u03b2 must exist.\nTo compute this \u03b2, the aforementioned results can be used as well as the computations from the proof of Theorem A.9. The computation is as follows, using the aforementioned results,\n\u2022 g1 \u2013 B = 0 \u2022 a1 \u2013 B = max { O (\u221a pk3 L + k4 L2 ) ,O ( k2 + \u221a pk3 L + k4 L2 )}\n\u2022 g2 \u2013 B = max { O ( pk3 L + \u221a pk4 L2 ) ,O (\u221a pk3 + k2L + pk3 L + \u221a pk4 L2 )} \u2022 a2 \u2013 B = max { O ( p2k10 L4 3 ) ,O ( p2k10L2 2\n)} \u2022 g3 \u2013 B = max { O ( p4k16 L6 5 ) ,O ( p5/2k10L2 2\n)} Above, next to each transformation, is the bound B on its second partial derivatives. The bounds are computed with respect to L \u2264 1 and L > 1, and then the maximum is taken over both cases. By a simple inductive argument for i \u2265 2,\n\u2022 gi \u2013\nB = max { O ( p2i\u22123/2k6i\u22128\nL2i\u22122 2i\u22123\n) ,O ( p2 i\u22121\u22121/2k5\u00d72 i\u22121 L2 i\u22122\n2i\u22121\n)}\n\u2022 ai \u2013\nB = max { O ( p2i\u22122k6i\u22122\nL2i 2i\u22121\n) ,O ( p2 i\u22121k5\u00d72 i L2 i\u22121\n2i\n)}\nUsing the bounds derived above, the bounds from Theorem A.9 and Lemma A.10 gives\n\u03b2 = max { O ( Q p3Q+5/2k9Q\u22122\nL2Q 3Q\u22121\n) ,O ( Q p2 Q+Q+2k5\u00d72 Q+3QL2 Q\u22121+1\n2Q+Q\n)} .\nA.3 GENERALIZABILITY\nWith the necessary properties demonstrated, we arrive at Theorem A.16. By p denote the number of nodes per layer and Q the number of hidden layers.\nTheorem A.16. Consider a fully connected network with a softmax output layer and NPF (L, T ) activation functions. Assume we use SGD with a max-norm constraint on the weight matrix and biases in the affine layers and on the coefficients of the activation functions to train the network.

Theoretically speaking, our approach improves upon this by fully exploring the space of possible activation functions \u2013 not merely considering those which are piecewise linear. Learning activation functions, in conjunction with the weights in the layer transformations, allows for the fitting of an arbitrary function of the output of the previous layer. A similar idea is Network in Network, due to Lin et al. (2013). There the authors propose to replace standard convolution layers with what they call mlpconv layers. Traditional convolution layers, if using a sigmoid activation, are essentially learning a generalized linear model of the previous layer\u2019s output. Their innovation is to use a more general nonlinear function estimator as the filter \u2013 a multilayer perceptron. Thus, their scheme fits in the back-propagation framework and so is easy to implement. Our approach is different because though we are learning arbitrary functions of the previous layer, our activation function approach can be used in any layer of the network and in networks without convolution layers, which theirs cannot.
