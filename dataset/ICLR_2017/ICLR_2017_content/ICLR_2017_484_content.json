Instances that have multiple labels naturally occur in many application domains, including multimedia information retrieval, tag recommendation, semantic scene classification, query categorization, gene function prediction, medical diagnosis, drug discovery, and marketing.\nA popular approach to the multi-label learning problem is to embed the labels in a low-dimensional latent space via linear or local non-linear embeddings. The approach of Hsu et al. (2009) projects the label vectors to a random low-dimensional space, fits a regression model in this space, then projects these predictions back to the original label space. Balasubramanian & Lebanon (2012) use a sparsity-regularized least squares reconstruction objective to select a small set of landmark labels that are used to predict the remaining labels. Bi & Kwok (2013) take a similar approach, with a greatly decreased computation cost, by posing the problem of selecting the landmark labels as one of column subset selection and adopting the leverage score sampling approach (Boutsidis et al., 2009). Recently, Yu et al. (2014) and Jing et al. (2015) propose using trace norm regularization to identify a low-dimensional representation of the original large label space. Mineiro & Karampatziakis (2015) use randomized dimensionality reduction to learn a low-dimensional embedding that explicitly captures correlations between the instance features and their labels. These approaches, like other linear embedding methods, assume that the label matrix is low-rank. However, the label matrix in most applications of multi-label learning is a sparse binary matrix, and thus is extremely likely to violate this low-rank assumption (Bhatia et al., 2015).\nRather than working with the original label and feature matrices, some methods work instead with label or feature similarity matrices, and seek to preserve the local structure of the data in the learned low-dimensional latent space. Tai & Lin (2010) use PCA on the label covariance matrix to extract a low-dimensional latent space for labels and Chen & Lin (2012) extend this method to integrate feature information. Lin et al. (2014) apply PCA to a similarity matrix constructed using both label and feature information; this approach is time-consuming as it requires computing a large similarity matrix. Nam et al. (2014) introduce a neural network model to capture non-linear relationships between the input features and the labels. However, this approach is computationally infeasible when the number of possible labels is large. Similarly, Ciss\u00e9 et al. (2016) shows that using a deep learning approach built on top of an informative partitioning of the label space gives good performance; the scalability of this method was not characterized. Prabhu & Varma (2014) propose a method to efficiently train a classification tree by minimizing the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain. Rai et al. (2015) assumes that the label vectors are generated by sampling from a weighted combination of label topics, where the mixture coefficients are determined by the instance features.\nBhatia et al. (2015) proposes a multi-phase algorithm (SLEEC) that first clusters the instances into a number of relatively small groups, learns label embeddings for each group via an SVD, and then trains linear regressors from the input features to the latent label factors for each group. SLEEC empirically outperforms previous state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers, but the label embedding in each group is learned from a nearest neighbor graph that is constructed solely from labelling information, ignoring the available feature matrix; the feature matrix has been shown repeatedly to be a source of useful information for label embedding (Chen & Lin, 2012; Lin et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2014; Jing et al., 2015).\nThe contribution of this paper is a scalable, accurate, and simple neural network approach to multilabel learning. Experiments establish that our method is faster and more accurate than SLEEC, the current state-of-the-art scalable algorithm.\nNotation: In the sequel, n is the number of training instances, c is the cardinality of the set of possible labels, d is the dimensionality of the feature vectors, and r is the dimension of the learned latent space. The matrix X \u2208 Rn\u00d7d contains the instance features, and Y \u2208 0, 1n\u00d7c indicates the labels assigned to each instance. We denote the number of observed labels for instance i with `i = \u2211c k=1 yik. The notations Ai\u00b7 and A\u00b7j respectively refer to the ith row and jth column of the matrix A. Unless otherwise specified, the notation f(A) denotes the elementwise application of an arbitrary function f to the A, so for example exp(A)ij = exp(aij)."}, {"heading": "2 THE SEMANTIC EMBEDDING MODEL", "text": "Our Semantic Embedding Model (SEM) assumes that the underlying parameters determining the observed labels are low-rank rather than that the observed label matrix is itself low-rank, and it uses a nonlinear model to fit the probability distributions over the labels, conditioned on the instance features.\nSEM models the i-th row of Y as the result of `i draws from a multinomial distribution: Yi\u00b7 \u223c Multinomial(`i;Pi), where P = [\nexp(hij)\u2211c k=1 exp(hik) ] i=1,...,n j=1,...,c . (1)\nThe parameter matrix H = UVT + 1nbT is the sum of label priors b \u2208 Rc and the product of explanatory latent factors associated with the instances (U \u2208 Rn\u00d7r) and the labels (V \u2208 Rc\u00d7r). Further, we allow the latent factors associated with each instance to be a nonlinear function of the features associated with that instance, U = f(X,W) for some W to be learned. We note that if f(X,W) = XW, SEM could be viewed as fitting a Bayesian Exponential Family PCA (Mohamed et al., 2009). However, throughout this paper we take f(XW) = \u03c3(XW), where \u03c3(X) = (1 + exp(\u2212X))\u22121 denotes the elementwise application of the sigmoid function, as we find this gives good results; with this choice, SEM is more naturally viewed as a neural network model.\nWe fit the SEM parameters by maximizing the likelihood of the observed labels. This is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the KL divergences between the empirical label distributions for each instance and the label distributions predicted by the model (Pawitan, 2001). Accordingly, we define the empirical label distribution matrix G, whose ith row satisfies Gi = Yi/`i, then minimize the\nrow-wise Kullback-Leibler distance (Yang et al., 2011) between G and P:\nJG||P = n\u2211\ni=1 c\u2211 j=1 Gij log Gij Pij \u223c= \u2212 n\u2211 i=1 c\u2211 j=1 Gij logPij .

To solve it efficiently, we use a Gauss-Siedel approach combined with mini-batching.\nNamely, we cyclically update each of W,V, and b using AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) while keeping the other two variable fixed. We compute the gradients using mini-batches. To state the expressions for the gradients with respect to the model parameters, we introduce some helpful notation: A B denotes the entry-wise product of two matrices, M = \u03c3(XW) (1\u2212 \u03c3(XW)), and D = Diag ( exp (\u03c3(XW)VT + 1nb T )1c ) .

To further reduce the running time of our algorithm, we note that in practice, each instance is often associated with `i c labels. To speed up the training, at each timestep \u03c4 , rather than attempting to minimize the divergence between the entire empirical and predicted label distributions of each instance, we sample a set of labels L(\u03c4)i for each instance and attempt to minimize the empirical and predicted marginal label distributions over that set of labels L(\u03c4)i . Let PLi denote the set of labels assigned to the ith instance, and ALi denote the set of labels not assigned to that instance. We sample from ALi to form a set NLi, and use L (\u03c4) i = PLi \u222a NL (\u03c4) i . This leads to the modified objective\nJMarginal(W,V,b)(\u03c4) = \u2212 n\u2211 i=1 \u2211 j\u2208L(\u03c4)i Gij log exp(\u03c3(XW)i\u00b7(V T )\u00b7j + bj)\u2211 k\u2208L(\u03c4)i exp(\u03c3(XW)i\u00b7(VT )\u00b7k + bk) . (10)\nNote that J (\u03c4) is a random function that changes at each timestep. Minimizing this stochastic objective effectively seeks SEM parameters which fit all the randomly sampled marginals encountered during training. Thus it is important to sample the sets NLi so that the selected marginals capture non-trivial information about the label distributions. One can imagine that uniformly sampling from ALi will not provide very informative marginals. As an improvement on this na\u00efve scheme, we sample labels from ALi with probability proportional to their frequency of occurrence in the training data set. The number of negative labels is set to be \u03b2 times the number of positive labels i.e., |NLi| = \u03b2|PLi| = \u03b2`i. Further, when m > 1, to faciliate efficient BLAS operations while mini-batching, we use the same marginals for each instance in the same minibatch, i.e., we fit marginals over L(\u03c4) := \u22c3 i\u2208Iz L (\u03c4) i , where Iz denotes the set of instances in the current minibatch.\nIn the experiments presented in Section 4, we found that \u03b2 around 10 suffices when c is relatively small, and \u03b2 around 100 suffices when c is on the order of tens of thousands."}, {"heading": "3.2 LABEL PREDICTION", "text": "We present two methods for predicting the labels for a new instance x \u2208 Rd given the fitted SEM parameters.\nThe first uses the generative model behind SEM: form h = \u03c3(xTW)VT+bT and note the probability that the jth label is assigned to that instance is given by\nP(yj = 1) = exp(hj)/ c\u2211\nk=1\nexp(hk). (11)\nAccordingly we assign the most probable labels to x. We call this prediction scheme the direct SEM method; it simply requires choosing the labels corresponding to the largest entries of h.\nThe second method builds a kernel classifier in the semantic space obtained from the SEM factorization. Following Mineiro & Karampatziakis (2015), a classifier is trained on these semantic representations by solving the optimization problem\nmin Z\u2208Rc\u00d7s n\u2211 i=1 `(Yi\u00b7,Z\u03c8(xiW)) + \u03bb\u2016Z\u20162F , (12)\nwhere ` is the log-loss penalty and \u03c8 : Rr \u2192 Rs is an s-dimensional Random Fourier Feature (RFF) map (Rahimi & Recht, 2007):\n\u03c8(x) = cos (\u03a6x + \u03b8) , (13)\nwhere \u03a6 \u2208 Rs\u00d7r is a matrix of i.i.d. standard Gaussians and \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)s is a vector of i.i.d uniform samples from [0, 2\u03c0).\nAt test time, the predicted label probabilities for an instance x are given by Z\u03c8(xW), so we assign the most probable labels according to this model. We refer to this scheme as the kernelized SEM method."}, {"heading": "4 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In the sequel we refer to the direct SEM scheme as simply SEM, and the kernelized SEM scheme as SEM-K.

We do not compare to the models proposed in (Tai & Lin, 2010; Chen & Lin, 2012; Bi & Kwok, 2013; Yu et al., 2014; Prabhu & Varma, 2014) because earlier works (Yu et al., 2014; Bhatia et al., 2015) have shown that they are inferior to SLEEC."}, {"heading": "4.1 DATASETS", "text": "Table 1 summarizes the eight datasets used in our experiments.

Due to there being several parameters for each method, we hand-tuned the parameters for each dataset as suggested by the authors. All methods were run in MATLAB on a Windows server with 4GB memory and four 2.3GHz CPUs with eight cores.\nThe prediction performance for each algorithm is evaluated according to widely-used metrics in the field of multi-label classification, viz., label-based Macro-F1 (MaF1) and Micro-F1 (MiF1) and instance-based Precision-at-k (P@k, esp. P@1 and P@3) (Zhang & Zhou, 2014). MaF1 and MiF1 require predefining a threshold to determine the number of labels to be assigned to the testing data. In our experiments, the number of labels assigned to each testing instance was set according to its ground truth."}, {"heading": "4.3 PERFORMANCE ON DATASETS WITH SMALL LABEL SETS", "text": "First we compare the performance on six multi-label learning problems with c < 1000. To fit both SEM models, we take the number of epochs be 30 and the mini-batch size be 200\u2014i.e., T = 30 and m = 200 in Algorithm 1\u2014and because c is small, we fit the full label distributions. The classification performances of our SEM algorithms and the baseline methods are shown in Table 2. SEM or SEM-K outperform the alternative algorithms in most cases.\nTable 3 compares the running times of the algorithms as the size of the dataset is increased, using MediaMill. We see that SEM is the fastest model, followed by REMBED, then closely by SEM-K; the remaining three models are significantly more costly. It is clear that NNML, the previous neural\nnetwork approach to multi-label learning costs the most. In the other five algorithms, the latent space dimensionality (r) is set to be 50. SLEEC is expensive because it constructs the nearest neighbor graph among training data and computes the top r eigenvectors of the corresponding similarity matrix, which costs O(n2r + d2r). REmbed is efficient because its main cost is to find the singular vectors of a c\u00d7 (r + q) matrix (here c is the number of labels and q is a small integer), but its performance is inferior to SEM-K. The BMLPL code provided by the author applies SVD to the training data to initialize than model parameters and then uses conjugate gradient to update the parameters, thus it costs much more than REmbed and our proposed methods."}, {"heading": "4.4 PERFORMANCE ON DATASETS WITH LARGE LABEL SETS", "text": "We proposed using SEM to fit marginals rather than the entire label distribution when c is large, for computational efficiency. To judge the effectiveness of this proposal, we compare the accuracy and running times of the SEM and SEM-K models with baselines on EurLex-des and Wiki10K, two datasets with c > 1000. As baselines, we use REmbed and SLEEC in accordance with the above discussion which showed that these two methods are efficient and/or have good performance.\nThe hyperparameters in SLEEC were set according to the original authors\u2019 code: r for EurLex-des and Wiki10K is 100 and 75 respectively, and 3 clusters are used for Eurlex-des and 5 are used for Wiki10K. To fit the SEM models, we used the same value of r as SLEEC on these two datasets and used 10 training epochs. For REmbed, the latent space size r was tuned via cross-validation; r = 300 for Eurlex-des and r = 150 for Wiki10K. The number of Random Fourier Features is 2000 for both REmbed and SEM-K. The latent space size r in SEM is same with SLEEC. The mini-batch sizes and number of epochs are set to be 200 and 10 respectively when fitting the SEM models.

Effect of Latent Space Dimensionality", "text": "It can be seen that the latent space dimensionality r plays an important role to learn latent factors V and a feature mapping matrix W in our proposed methods, as it does in the three baselines BMLPL, REmbed and SLEEC. In order to investigate this dependence, we conducted a series of experiments on the training data sets using 5-fold cross-validation, comparing BMLPL, REmbed, SLEEC and our proposed SEM and SEM-K.\nIn this experiment, we take Delicious dataset as an example. The training data is separated into five folds where four folds are used as training and one fold as validating, and the averaged results in terms of P@1 and MiF1 are given by Figure 3. It can be seen that their performances usually improve with increasing r until they reach an optimum value. However, once r becomes too large, their performances degrade. This is reasonable: when r is too small, the learned parameters cannot fully characterize the hidden semantic structure in the classification problem, while when r is too large, the benefits of dimensionality reduction are lost, as the model begins to over-fit to the idiosyncrasies of the training data rather than capturing the semantic structure common to both the training and validation data. Usually, these methods could obtain good performance at small r, say 45 for Delicious dataset."}, {"heading": "B. Effect of training data size", "text": "Meanwhile, we studied the label prediction performance as a function of the amount of labeled training data. In this experiment, we fixed the testing data size, and randomly selected training data from the training set so that the training data size varies from 1% to 70% of the combined training and testing data. In order to avoid the presence of empty categories and instances with no labels, at least one instance is kept for each label and at least one label is kept for each instance during this sampling process. For each fixed size of the training set, the desired amount of data is randomly\nsampled ten times, and the resulting average P@1 and MiF1 on the testing data are recorded. During training, the latent dimensionality parameter r is selected via 5-fold cross-validation.\nFigure 4 shows these results for the Mediamill dataset which contains the largest number of instances. As expected, the performance of all the methods is positive correlated with the size of the training data set, and we also see that the proposed SEM-K uniformly outperforms the other methods regardless of the training data size. As it is often expensive to obtain large labeled data sets in real applications, this observation suggests that SEM-K is a better choice for these situations."}, {"heading": "C. Convergence", "text": "In order to demonstrated the convergence of the proposed method, we show the value of objective function (4) (at r = 45) via Figure 5(a) and the prediction result (P@1) via Figure 5(b) along with the number of passes to the dataset (i.e., \u03c4 in Algorithm 1).

The main challenge is to maintain accurate predictions while scaling efficiently on data sets with extremely large label sets and many training data points. We propose a simple but effective neural net approach, the Semantic Embedding Model (SEM), that models the labels for an instance as draws from a multinomial distribution parametrized by nonlinear functions of the instance features. A Gauss-Siedel mini-batch adaptive gradient descent algorithm is used to fit the model. To handle extremely large label sets, we propose and experimentally validate the efficacy of fitting randomly chosen marginal label distributions. Experimental results on eight real-world data sets show that SEM garners significant performance gains over existing methods. In particular, we compare SEM to four recent state-ofthe-art algorithms (NNML, BMLPL, REmbed, and SLEEC) and find that SEM uniformly outperforms these algorithms in several widely used evaluation metrics while requiring significantly less training time.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}, "id": "ICLR_2017_484"}
