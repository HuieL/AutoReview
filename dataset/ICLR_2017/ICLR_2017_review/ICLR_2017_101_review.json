The algorithm seems clear, the problem well-recognized, and the results are both strong and plausible.\n\nApproaches to hyperparameter optimization based on SMBO have struggled to make good use of convergence during training, and this paper presents a fresh look at a non-SMBO alternative (at least I thought it did, until one of the other reviewers pointed out how much overlap there is with the previously published successive halving algorithm - too bad!). Still, I'm excited to try it. I'm cautiously optimistic that this simple alternative to SMBO may be the first advance to model search for the skeptical practitioner since the case for random search > grid search (http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v13/bergstra12a.html, which this paper should probably cite in connection with their random search baseline.)\n\nI would suggest that the authors remove the (incorrect?) claim that this algorithm is \"embarrassingly parallel\" as it seems that there are number of synchronization barriers at which state must be shared in order to make the go-no-go decisions on whatever training runs are still in progress.  As the authors themselves point out as future work, there are interesting questions around how to adapt this algorithm to make optimal use of a cluster (I'm optimistic that it should carry over, but it's not trivial).\n\nFor future work, the authors might be interested in Hutter et al's work on Bayesian Optimization With Censored Response Data (https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1947) for some ideas about how to use the dis-continued runs.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "This paper discusses Hyperband, an extension of successive halving by Jamieson & Talwalkar (AISTATS 2016). Successive halving is a very nice algorithm that starts evaluating many configurations and repeatedly cuts off the current worst half to explore many configuration for a limited budget.\n\nHaving read the paper for the question period and just rereading it again, I am now not entirely sure what its contribution is meant to be: the only improvement of Hyperband vs. successive halving is in the theoretical worst case bounds (not more than 5x worse than random search), but you can (a) trivially obtain that bound by using a fifth of your time for running random configurations to completion and (b) the theoretical analysis to show this is said to be beyond the scope of the paper. That makes me wonder whether the theoretical results are the contribution of this paper, or whether they are the subject of a different paper and the current paper is mostly an empirical study of the method?\nI hope to get a response by the authors and see this made clearer in an updated version of the paper.\n\nIn terms of experiments, the paper fails to show a case where Hyperband actually performs better than the authors' previous algorithm successive halving with its most agressive setting of bracket b=4. Literally, in every figure, bracket b=4 is at least as good (and sometimes substantially better) than Hyperband. That makes me think that in practice I would prefer successive halving with b=4 over Hyperband. (And if I really want Hyperband's guarantee of not being more than 5x worse than random search I can run random search on a fifth of my machines.) \nThe experiments also compare to some Bayesian optimization methods, but not to the most relevant very closely related Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization methods that have been dominating effective methods for deep learning in that area in the last 3 years: \"Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization\" by Swersky, Snoek, and Adams (2013) already showed 5x speedups for deep learning by starting with smaller datasets, and there have been several follow-up papers showing even larger speedups. \n\nGiven that this prominent work on multitask Bayesian optimization exists, I also think the introduction, which sells Hyperband as a very new approach to hyperparameter optimization is misleading. I would've much preferred a more down-to-earth pitch that says \"configuration evaluation\" has been becoming a very important feature in hyperparameter optimization, including Bayesian optimization, that sometimes yields very large speedups (this can be quantified by examples from existing papers) and this paper adds some much-needed theoretical understanding to this and demonstrates how important configuration evaluation is even in the simplest case of being used with random search. I think this could be done easily and locally by adding a paragraph to the intro.\n\nAs another point regarding novelty, I think the authors should make clear that approaches for adaptively deciding how many resources to use for which evaluation have been studied for (at least) 23 years in the ML community -- see Maron & Moore, NIPS 1993: \"Hoeffding Races: Accelerating Model Selection Search for Classification and Function Approximation\" (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/841-hoeffding-races-accelerating-model-selection-search-for-classification-and-function-approximation). Again, this could be done by a paragraph in the intro. \n\nOverall, I think for this paper having the related work section at the end leads to many concepts appearing to be new in the paper that turn out not to be new in the end, which is a bit of a let-down. I encourage the authors to prominently discuss related work, including the recent trends in Bayesian optimization towards configuration evaluation, in the beginning, and then clearly state the contribution of this paper by positioning it in the context of that related work and saying what exactly is new. (I think the answer is \"very simple method\", \"great empirical results for several deep learning tasks\" and \"much-needed new theoretical results\", which is a very nice contribution.) I'm giving an accepting score trusting that the authors will follow this suggestion.\n\n\nI have some responses to some of the author responses:\n\n1) \"In response to your question, we ran an experiment modeled after the empirical studies in Krueger et al tuning 2 hyperparameters of a kernel SVM to compare CVST (Krueger et al 2015) and Hyperband.  Hyperband is 3-4x faster than CVST on this experiment and the two achieve similar test performance.  Notably, CVST was only 50% faster than standard holdout.   For the experiments in our paper, we excluded CVST due to the aforementioned theoretical differences and because CVST is not an anytime algorithm, but as we perform more experiments, we will update the draft to reflect this comparison.\"\n\nGreat, I am looking forward to seeing the details on these experiments before the decision phase.\n\n2) \"Hyperband makes no assumptions on the shape or rate of convergence of the validation error, just that it eventually converges.\"\n\nIt's only the worst-case analysis that makes no assumption, but of course one would not be happy with that worst-case performance of being 5x worse than random search. (The 5x is what the authors call \"modestly worse, by a log factor\"; it's the logarithm of the dataset size or of the number of epochs, both of which tend to be large numbers). I think this number of 5x should be stated explicitly somewhere for the authors choice of Hyperband parameters. (E.g., at the beginning of the experiments, when Hyperband's parameters are stated.)\n\n3) \"Like random search, it is also embarrassingly parallel.\"\n\nI think this is not quite correct. Let's say I want to tune hyperparameters on ImageNet and each hyperparameter evaluation takes 1 week, but I have 100 GPUs, then random search will give a decent solution (the best of 100 random configurations) after 1 week. However, Hyperband will require 5 weeks before it will give any solution. Again, the modest log factor is a factor of 5. To me, \"embarassingly parallel\" would mean making great predictions after a week if you throw enough resources at it.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, {"review": "This paper presents Hyperband, a method for hyperparameter optimization where the model is trained by gradient descent or some other iterative scheme. The paper builds on the successive halving + random search approach of Jamieson and Talwalkar and addresses the tradeoff between training fewer models for a longer amount of time, or many models for a shorter amount of time. Effectively, the idea is to perform multiple rounds of successive halving, starting from the most exploratory setting, and then in each round exponentially decreasing the number of experiments, but granting them exponentially more resources. In contrast to other recent papers on this topic, the approach here does not rely on any specific model of the underlying learning curves and therefore makes fewer assumptions about the nature of the model. The results seem to show that this approach can be highly effective, often providing several factors of speedup over sequential approaches.\n\nOverall I think this paper is a good contribution to the hyperparameter optimization literature. It\u2019s relatively simple to implement, and seems to be quite effective for many problems. It seems like a natural extension of the random search methodology to the case of early stopping. To me, it seems like Hyperband would be most useful on problems where a) random search itself is expected to perform well and b) the computational budget is sufficiently constrained so that squeezing out the absolute best performance is not feasible and near-optimal performance is sufficient. I would personally like to see the plots in Figure 3 run out far enough that the other methods have had time to converge in order to see what this gap between optimal and near-optimal really is (if there is one).\n\nI\u2019m not sure I agree with the use of random2x as a baseline. I can see why it\u2019s a useful comparison because it demonstrates the benefit of parallelism over sequential methods, but virtually all of these other methods also have parallel extensions. I think if random2x is shown, then I would also like to see SMAC2x, Spearmint2x, TPE2x, etc. I also think it would be worth seeing 3x, 10x, and so forth and how Hyperband fares against these baselines.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}]}
