The idea of using an embedded bi-RNN to approximate the posterior is a reasonable and clever idea. \n\nThat being said, I think two aspects may need further improvement:\n(1) An explanation as to why a bi-RNN can provide more accurate approximations than other modeling choices (e.g. structured mean field that uses a sequential model to formulate the variational distribution) is needed. I think it would make the paper stronger if the authors can explain in an intuitive way why this modeling choice is better than some other natural choices (in addition to empirical verification).\n(2) The real world datasets seem to be quite small (e.g. less than 100 sequences). Experimental results reported on larger datasets may also strengthen the paper.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "Putting the score for now, will post the full review tomorrow.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "This paper presents a novel model for unsupervised segmentation and classification of time series data.  A recurrent hidden semi-markov model is proposed.  This extends regular hidden semi-markov models to include a recurrent neural network (RNN) for observations.  Each latent class has its own RNN for modeling observations for that category.  Further, an efficient training procedure based on a variational approximation.  Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for modeling synthetic and real time series data.\n\nThis is an interesting and novel paper.  The proposed method is a well-motivated combination of duration modeling HMMs with state of the art observation models based on RNNs.  The combination alleviates shortcomings of standard HSMM variants in terms of the simplicity of the emission probability.  The method is technically sound and demonstrated to be effective.\n\nIt would be interesting to see how this method compares quantitatively against CRF-based methods (e.g. Ammar, Dyer, and Smith NIPS 2014).  CRFs can model more complex data likelihoods, though as noted in the response phase there are still limitations.  Regardless, I think the merits of using RNNs for the class-specific generative models are clear.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}]}
