You may achieve similar reductions with inclusion of pruning (or better since you go to 4 bits with no loss) but we should see this in the paper, so at the moment it is difficult to compare", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "There is a great deal of ongoing interest in compressing neural network models. One line of work has focused on using low-precision representations of the model weights, even down to 1 or 2 bits. However, so far these approaches have been accompanied by a significant impact on accuracy. The paper proposes an iterative quantization scheme, in which the network weights are quantized in stages---the largest weights (in absolute value) are quantized and fixed, while unquantized weights can adapt to compensate for any resulting error. The experimental results show this is extremely effective, yielding models with 4 bit or 3 bit weights with essentially no reduction in accuracy. While at 2 bits the accuracy decreases slightly, the results are substantially better than those achieved with other quantization approaches.\n\nOverall this paper is clear, the technique is as far as I am aware novel, the experiments are thorough and the results are very compelling, so I recommend acceptance. The paper could use another second pass for writing style and grammar. Also, the description of the pruning-inspired partitioning strategy could be clarified somewhat... e.g., the chosen splitting ratio of 50% only seems to be referenced in a figure caption and not the main text.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "The idea of this paper is reasonable - gradually go from original weights to compressed weights by compressing a part of them and fine-tuning the rest. Everything seems fine, results look good, and my questions have been addressed.\n\nTo improve the paper:\n\n1) It would be good to incorporate some of the answers into the paper, mainly the results with pruning + this method as that can be compared fairly to Han et al. and outperforms it.\n\n2) It would be good to better explain the encoding method (my question 4) as it is not that clear from the paper (e.g. made me make a mistake in question 5 for the computation of n2). The \"5 bits\" is misleading as in fact what is used is variable length encoding (which is on average close to 5 bits) where:\n- 0 is represented with 1 bit, e.g. 0\n- other values are represented with 5 bits, where the first bit is needed to distinguish from 0, and the remaining 4 bits represent the 16 different values for the powers of 2.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}]}
