This paper describes a method to extrapolate a given dataset and predict formulae with naturally occurring functions like sine, cosine, multiplication etc.                                                                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nPros                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n- The approach is rather simple and hence can be applied to existing methods. The major difference is incorporating functions with 2 or more inputs which was done successfully in the paper. \n            \n- It seems that MLP, even though it is good for interpolation, it fails to extrapolate data to model the correct function. It was a great idea to use basis functions like sine, cosine to make the approach more explicit.                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nCons                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n- Page 8, the claim that x2 cos(ax1 + b) ~ 1.21(cos(-ax1 + \u03c0 + b + 0.41x2) + sin(ax1 + b + 0.41x2)) for y in [-2,2] is not entirely correct. There should be some restrictions on 'a' and 'b' as well as the approximate equality doesn't hold for all real values of 'a' and 'b'. Although, for a=2*pi and b=pi/4, the claim is correct so the model is predicting a correct solution within certain limits.      \n                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n- Most of the experiments involve up to 4 variables. It would be interesting to see how the neural approach models hundreds of variables.                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n- Another way of looking at the model is that the non-linearities like sine, cosine, multiplication act as basis functions. If the data is a linear combination of such functions, the model will be able to learn the weights. As division is not one of the non-linearities, predicting expressions in Equation 13 seems unlikely. Hence, I was wondering, is it possible to make sure that this architecture is a universal approximator.                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nSuggested Edits                                                                                                                                                                                           \n- Page 8, It seems that there is a typographical error in the expression 1.21(cos(ax1 + \u03c0 + b + 0.41x2) + sin(ax1 + b + 0.41x2)). When compared with the predicted formula in Figure 4(b), it should be 1.21(cos(-ax1 + \u03c0 + b + 0.41x2) + sin(ax1 + b + 0.41x2)).

Being able to capture succinct and interpretable rules which a physical system follows is of great importance. However, the authors do this with simple and naive tools which will not scale to complex tasks, offering no new insights or advances to the field. \n\nThe contribution of the paper (and the first four pages of the submission!) can be summarised in one sentence: \n\"Learn the weights of a small network with cosine, sinusoid, and input elements products activation functions s.t. the weights are sparse (L1)\".\nThe learnt network weights with its fixed structure are then presented as the learnt equation. \n\nThis research uses tools from literature from the '90s (I haven't seen the abbreviation ANN (page 3) for a long time) and does not build on modern techniques which have advanced a lot since then. I would encourage the authors to review modern literature and continue working on this important task.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "Thank you for an interesting read. \n\nTo my knowledge, very few papers have looked at transfer learning with **no** target domain data (the authors called this task as \"extrapolation\"). This paper clearly shows that the knowledge of the underlying system dynamics is crucial in this case. The experiments clearly showed the promising potential of the proposed EQL model. I think EQL is very interesting also from the perspective of interpretability, which is crucial for data analysis in scientific domains.\n\nQuesions and comments:\n\n1. Multiplication units. By the universal approximation theorem, multiplication can also be represented by a neural network in the usual sense. I agree with the authors' explanation of interpolation and extrapolation, but I still don't quite understand why multiplication unit is crucial here. I guess is it because this representation generalises better when training data is not that representative for the future?\n\n2. Fitting an EQL vs. fitting a polynomial. It seems to me that the number of layers in EQL has some connections to the degree of the polynomial. Assume we know the underlying dynamics we want to learn can be represented by a polynomial. Then what's the difference between fitting a polynomial (with model selection techniques to determine the degree) and fitting an EQL (with model selection techniques to determine the number of layers)? Also your experiments showed that the selection of basis functions (specific to the underlying dynamics you want to learn) is crucial for the performance. This means you need to have some prior knowledge on the form of the equation anyway!\n\n3. Ben-David et al. 2010 has presented some error bounds for the hypothesis that is trained on source data but tested on the target data. I wonder if your EQL model can achieve better error bounds?\n\n4. Can you comment on the comparison of your method to those who modelled the extrapolation data with **uncertainty**?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}]}
