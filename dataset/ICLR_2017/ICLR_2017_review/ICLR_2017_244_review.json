{"id": "ICLR_2017_244", "reviews": [{"review": "The paper is well motivated and well written. The setting of the experiments is to investigate a particular case. While the results of experiments are interesting, such investigation is not likely to systematically improve our understanding of the adversarial example phenomenon. Overall, the contribution of the paper seems incremental. \n\nPros:\n1. This paper proposes the iterative LL method, which is efficient in both computation and success rate in generating adversarial examples. This method could be useful when the number of classes in the dataset is huge.\n2. Some observations of the experiments are interesting. For example, overall photo transformation does not affect much the accuracy on clean image, but could destroy some adversarial methods. \n\nCons:\n1. As noticed by the authors, some similar works exist in the literature. According to the authors, what differs this work from other existing works is that this paper tend to fool NN by making very small perturbations of the input. But based on the experiments and the demonstration (the real pictures), it is arguable that the perturbations in the experiments are still small.\n2. Some hypotheses proposed in the paper based on one-shot experiments seems too rushy.\n3. As mentioned above, the results of this paper seems not really improving the understanding of the adversarial example phenomenon.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "In some sense, the Sharif et al. work \"scooped\" this paper, but as the authors indicate, the spirit of the work remains somewhat different. Sharif's approach was constrained in an interesting way (usable surface area limited to front portion of glasses frames) and also a bit gimmicky (focused on fooling a small scale face ID system to select among a set of celebrities). The present work is less sensational and more methodical in its study of physical manifestations of adversarial patterns for standard benchmark objects. I think the paper is at least a little above the bar since it poses an interesting question and carries out an informative empirical study.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "Description.\nThe paper investigates whether adversarial examples survive different geometric and photometric image transformations,\nincluding a complex transformation where the image is printed on the paper and captured again by a cell-phone camera.\nThe paper considers three different methods to generate adversarial examples \u2014 images with added small amount of noise that changes the output of a classification neural network.  In the quantitative experiments the paper assumes available access to the neural network and its parameters. Qualitative results are shown for a set-up where the network used to generate adversarial images is different from the test network.   \n\nStrong  points.\n- adversarial examples are an interesting phenomenon that is worth detailed investigation.\n- the paper is well written and presented.\n- Results showing (and quantifying) that adversarial examples can survive a complex image transformation such as printing and re-capturing are interesting.\n- Experiments are well done and solid.\n\nWeak points:\n- Probably the main negative point is the amount of novelty and contribution. The paper essentially presents a set of experiments evaluating whether adversarial examples survive different image transformations. Apart from that there is no other main contribution / novelty. While the experiments are solid and well-done, this seems borderline.\n\nDetailed evaluation.\nOriginality:\n- the main contribution of this work is the experimental evaluation showing (and quantifying) how adversarial examples behave under various image transformations.  \n\nQuality:\n- The shown experiments are solid and well done.\n\nClarity:\n- The paper is well written and clear.\n\nSignificance:\n- The findings and shown experiments are interesting, but I not sure if the scale and amount of contribution is significant enough for the main conference track. \n\nOverall:\nExperimental paper. Well written. Solid experiments. Not sure if contribution is significant enough.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}]}
