In particular, the fact that the authors did not provide any results in \"real\" networks, which are used to win competitions makes the results less strong, since researchers who want to created competitive network architectures don't have enough evidence from this work to decides whether they should use it or not.\n\nIdeally, I would encourage the authors to consider continuing this line of research and show how to use the information given by these linear classifiers to construct better network architectures. \n\nUnfortunately, as is, I don't think we have enough novelty to justify accepting this work in the conference.

The training of the linear classifier does not affect the training of the neural network. \n\nThe paper is well motivated for investigating how much useful information (or how good the representations are) for each layer. The observations in this paper agrees with existing insights, such as, 1) (Fig 5a) too many random layers are harmful. 2) (Fig 5b) training is helpful. 3) (Fig 7) lower layers converge faster than higher layer. 4) (Fig 8) too deep network is hard to train, and skip link can remedy this problem.\n\nHowever, this paper has following problems:\n\n1. It is not sufficiently justified why the linear classifier is a good probe. It is not crystal clear why good intermediate features need to show high linear classification accuracy. More theoretical analysis and/or intuition will be helpful.   \n2. This paper does not provide much insight on how to design better networks based on the observations. Designing a better network is also the best way to justify the usefulness of the analysis.\n\nOverall, this paper is tackling an interesting problem, but the technique (the linear classifier as the probe) is not novel and more importantly need to be better justified. Moreover, it is important to show how to design better neural networks using the observations in this paper.\n  \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "The authors propose a method to investigate the predictiveness of intermediate layer activations.

This is correct and what I consider the main flaw of the paper. I am missing any motivation as to the usefulness of the suggested analysis to architecture design. In fact, the example with the skip connection (Figure 8) seems to suggest that skip connections shouldn't be used.
