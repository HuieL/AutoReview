{"id": "ICLR_2017_29", "reviews": [{"review": "This paper presents a framework for creating document representations. \nThe main idea is to represent a document as an average of its word embeddings with a data-dependent regularization that favors informative or rare words while forcing common words to be close to 0. \nExperiments on sentiment analysis and document classification show that the proposed method has the lowest error rates compared to baseline document embedding methods. \n\nWhile I like the motivation of finding the best way to encode a document into a vector, the paper does not offer significant technical contributions.\nMost of the techniques are not new, and the main selling point is the simplicity and speed of the proposed method. \nFor this reason, I would like to see good results for more than two tasks to be convinced that this is the best way to learn document representations.  \nFor RNN-LM, is the LM trained to minimize classification error, or is it trained  as a language model? Did you use the final hidden state as the representation, or the average of all hidden states?\nOne of the most widely used method to represent documents now is to have a bidirectional LSTM and concatenate the final hidden states as the document representation. \nI think it would be useful to know how the proposed method compares to this approach for tasks such as document classification or sentiment analysis.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "This paper discusses a method for computing vector representations for documents by using a skip-gram style learning mechanism with an added regularizer in the form of a global context vector with various bits of drop out. While none of the individual components proposed in this paper are new, I believe that the combination in this fashion is. Further, I appreciated the detailed analysis of model behaviour in section 3.\n\nThe main downside to this submission is in its relative weakness on the empirical front. Arguably there are more interesting tasks than sentiment analysis and k-way classification! Likewise, why waste 2/3 of a page on t-sne projections rather than use that space for further analysis?\n\nWhile I am a bit disappointed by this reduced evaluation and agree with the other reviewers concerning soft baselines, I think this paper should be accepted: it's an interesting algorithm, nicely composed and very efficient, so it's reasonable to assume that other readers might have use for some of the ideas presented here.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "This paper proposes learning document embeddings as a sum of the constituent word embeddings, which are jointly learned and randomly dropped out ('corrupted') during training. While none of the pieces of this model are particularly novel, the result is an efficient learning algorithm for document representation with good empirical performance.\n\nJoint training of word and document embeddings is not a new idea, nor is the idea of enforcing the document to be represented by the sum of its word embeddings (see, e.g. '\u201cThe Sum of Its Parts\u201d: Joint Learning of Word and Phrase Representations with Autoencoders' by Lebret and Collobert). Furthermore, the corruption mechanism is nothing other than traditional dropout on the input layer. Coupled with the word2vec-style loss and training methods, this paper offers little on the novelty front.\n\nOn the other hand, it is very efficient at generation time, requiring only an average of the word embeddings rather than a complicated inference step as in Doc2Vec. Moreover, by construction, the embedding captures salient global information about the document -- it captures specifically that information that aids in local-context prediction. For such a simple model, the performance on sentiment analysis and document classification is quite encouraging.\n\nOverall, despite the lack of novelty, the simplicity, efficiency, and performance of this model make it worthy of wider readership and study, and I recommend acceptance.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}]}
