{"id": "ICLR_2017_385", "reviews": [{"review": "This paper presents iterative PoWER, an off-policy variation on PoWER, a policy gradient algorithm in the reward-weighted family.\n\nI'm not familiar enough with this type lower bound scheme to comment on it. It looks like the end result is less conservative step sizes in policy parameter space. All expectation-based algorithms (and their KL-regularized cousins a-la TRPO) take smallish steps, and this might be a sensible way to accelerate them.\n\nThe description of the experiments in Section VI is insufficient for reproducibility. Is \"The cart moved right\" supposed to be \"a positive force is applied to the cart\"? How is negative force applied? What is the representation of the state? What is the distribution of initial states? A linear policy is insufficient for swing up and balance of a cart-pole. Are you only doing balancing? What is the noise magnitude of the policy? How was it chosen? How long were the episodes?\n\nThe footnote at the bottom of page 8 threw me off. If you're using Newton's method, where is the discussion of gradients and Hessians? I thought the argmax_theta operator was a stand-in for an EM-style step, which I how I read Eq (8) in the Kober paper. \nhttps://papers.nips.cc/paper/3545-policy-search-for-motor-primitives-in-robotics.pdf\nI might be missing something basic here.\n\nThe control variates thing seems cool. I only read up on it now and I don't think I've seen it before in the RL literature. Seems like a powerful tool.\n\nSection 6.2 has too much business jargon, I could barely read it.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, {"review": "The paper considers the problem of reinforcement learning where the number of policy updates is required to be low. The problem is well motivated and the author provides an interesting modification to the PoWER algorithm, along with variational bounds on the value function (lemmas 3,4) which are interesting in themselves. They also provide numerical results on the cartpole problem and a problem in online advertising with real data. Overall this is a strong, well-written paper. My main reservation is whether it is completely appropriate for ICLR, since the log-concavity assumption the model relies on appear to restrict to simpler models where representations will be not in fact be learned.\n\nOther comments:\n- There is a general lack of baselines in the numerical experiment section. I acknowledge this is somewhat of an unusual setting, but even a simple, well-justified baseline would have been welcome. Since cartpole is a relatively simple problem and the advertising dataset is presumably private, perhaps a way to generate a synthetic advertising dataset would have been interesting.\n\n- I was confused by the control variates as constant scalars - are they meant to be constant baselines? And if so, they appear to be treated as hyperparameters -  why are they not learned or estimated?\n\n- There is an interesting section on constrained optimization, but as it is, feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the paper. It appears applicable to the problem of online advertising, but is not mentioned in the corresponding experimental section. Also might be worth adding a citation to the literature of constrained MDPs which develops similar lagrangian ideas.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "The paper presents an interesting modification to PoWER algorithm that is well motivated. The main limitation of this paper is the lack of comparison with other methods and on richer problems. The experiments haven't given confidence to show its claimed benefits, generality and scalability over prior methods. Giving this confidence doesn\u2019t necessarily require running your method on all large-scale domains or doing exhaustic hyper-parameter search, but for example it could go beyond current domains. Cartpole only optimizes 5 parameters. Ad targeting task lacks comparison with alternative methods. Since this method is built on PoWER and closely connected with RWR, it is likely there are limits to performance which may become apparent when the method is tried on other domains and with other benchmark methods, e.g. even standard ones like importance sampling-based off-policy learning is known to suffer in high-dimensional or continuous action space; limits of RWR/PoWER-like methods based on their connection with entropy-regularized RL. https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06778 may be a valuable starting point for comparison, e.g. it compares RWR with policy gradient methods, and it has open-sourced codes.
