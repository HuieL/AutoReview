They first symbolize continuous inputs using a previously described approach (histograms or maximum entropy), the result being a multichannel discrete sequence (of symbolized time series or originally categorical data) of \"characters.\" They then investigate three different approaches to learning an embedding of the characters at each time step (which can be thought of as a \"word\"):\n1) Concatenate characters into a \"word\" and then apply standard lookup-based embeddings from language modeling (WDE)\n2) Embed each character independently and then sum over the embeddings (SCE)\n3) Embed each character as a scalar and concatenate the scalar embeddings (ICE)\nThe resulting embeddings can be used as inputs to any architecture, e.g., LSTM. The paper applies these methods primarily to event detection tasks, such as hard drive failures and seizures in EEG data. Empirical results largely suggest the a recurrent model combined with symbolization/embedding outperforms a comparable recurrent model applied to raw data. Results are inconclusive as to which embedding layer works best.\n\nStrengths:\n- The different embedding approaches, while simple, are designed to tackle a very interesting problem where the input consists of multivariate discrete sequences, which makes it different from standard language modeling and related domains. The proposed approaches offer several different interesting perspectives on how to approach this problem.\n- The empirical results suggest that symbolizing the continuous input space can improve results for some problems. This is an interesting possibility as it enables the direct application of a variety of language modeling tools (e.g., embeddings).\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The LSTMs (one layer each of 8, 16, and 15 cells, respectively) used in the three experiments sound *very* under capacity given the complexity of the tasks and the sizes of the data sets (tens to hundreds of thousands of sequences). That might explain both the relatively small gap between the LSTMs and logistic regression *and* the improvement of the embedding-based LSTMs. Hypothetically, if quantizing the inputs is really useful, the raw data LSTMs should be able to learn this transformation, but if they are under capacity, they might not be able to dos. What is more, using the same architecture (# layers, # units, etc.) for very different kinds of inputs (raw, WdE, SCE, ICE, hand-engineered features) is poor methodology. Obviously, hyperparameters should be tuned independently for each type of input.\n- The experiments omit obvious baselines, such as trying to directly learn an embedding of the continuous inputs.\n- The experimental results offer an incomplete, mixed conclusion. First, no one embedding approach performs best across all tasks and metrics, and the authors offer no insights into why this might be. Second, the current set of experiments are not sufficiently thorough to conclude that quantization and embedding is superior to working with the raw data.\n- The temporal weighting section appears out of place: it is unrelated to the core of the paper (quantizing and embedding continuous inputs), and there are no experiments to demonstrate its impact on performance.\n- The paper omits a large number of related works: anything by Eamonn Keogh's lab (e.g., Symbolic Aggregate approXimation or SAX), work on modifying loss functions for RNN classifiers (Dai and Le. Semi-supervised sequence learning. NIPS 2015; Lipton and Kale, et al. Learning to Diagnose with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks. ICLR 2016), work on embedding non-traditional discrete sequential inputs (Choi, et al. Multi-layer Representation Learning for Medical Concepts. KDD 2016).\n\nThis is an interesting direction for research on time series modeling with neural nets, and the current work is a good first step. The authors need to perform more thorough experiments to test their hypotheses (i.e., that embedding helps performance). My intuition is that a continuous embedding layer + proper hyperparameter tuning will work just as well. If quantization proves to be beneficial, then I encourage them to pursue some direction that eliminates the need for ad hoc quantization, perhaps some kind of differentiable clustering layer?", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "In absence of authors' responses, the rating is maintained.\n\n---\n\nThis paper introduces an approach for learning predictive time series models that can handle heterogenous multivariate sequence. The first step is in three possible ways to perform embedding of the d-dimensional sequences into d-character words, or a sum of d character embeddings, or a concatenation of d character embeddings. The embedding layer is the first layer of a deep architecture such as LSTM. The models are then trained to perform event prediction at a fixed horizon, with temporal weighting, and applied to hard disk or heating system failures or seizures.\n\nThe approach is interesting and the results seem to outperform an LSTM baseline, but need additional clarification.\n\nThe experimental section on seizure prediction is very short and would need to be considerably extended, in an appendix. What are the results obtained using LSTM vs. RNN? What is the state-of-the-art on that dataset? Given that EEG data contain mostly frequential information, how is this properly handled in per-sample embeddings?\n\nPlease also extend your reference and previous work section to include PixelRNN as well as: \n* van den Oord, et al.
