{"id": "ICLR_2017_54", "reviews": [{"review": "The paper describes approaches taken to train learning agents for the 3D game Doom. The authors propose a number of performance enhancements (curriculum learning, attention (zoomed-in centered) frames, reward shaping, game variables, post-training rules) inspired by domain knowledge.\n\nThe enhancements together lead to a clear win as demonstrated by the competition results. From Fig 4, the curriculum learning clearly helps with learning over increasingly difficult settings. A nice result is that there is no overfitting to the harder classes once they have learned (probably because the curriculum is health and speed). The authors conclude from Fig 5 that the adaptive curriculum is better and more stable that pure A3C; however, this is a bit of a stretch given that graph. They go on to say that Pure A3C doesn't learn at all in the harder map but then show no result/graph to back this claim. Tbl 5 shows a clear benefit of the post-training rules.\n\nIf the goal is to solve problems like these (3D shooters), then this paper makes a significant contribution in that it shows which techniques are practical for solving the problem and ultimately improving performance in these kinds of tasks. Still, I am just not excited about this paper, mainly because it relies so heavily of many sources of domain knowledge, it is quite far from the pure reinforcement learning problem. The results are relatively unsurprising. Maybe they are novel for this problem, though.\n\nI'm not sure we can realistically draw any conclusions about Figure 6 in the paper's current form. I recommend the authors increase the resolution or run some actual metrics to determine the fuzziness/clarity of each row/image: something more concrete than an arrow of already low-resolution images.\n\n--- Added after rebuttal:\n\nI still do not see any high-res images for Figure 6 or any link to them, but I trust that the authors will add them if accepted.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "This paper basically applies A3C to 3D spatial navigation tasks. \n\n- This is not the first time A3C has been applied to 3D navigation. In fact the original paper reported these experiments. Although the experimental results are great, I am not sure if this paper has any additional insights to warrant itself as a conference paper. It might make more sense as a workshop paper\n\n-  Are the graphs in Fig 5 constructed using a single hyper-parameter sweep? I think the authors should report results with many random initializations to make the comparisons more robust\n\n- Overall the two main ideas in this paper -- A3C and curriculums -- are not really novel but the authors do make use of them in a real system.

I think it is fair to expect the competition aspect to overshadow the more scientific approach of justifying every design decision in isolation, but in fact the authors do a decent job at the latter.\n\nTwo of my concerns have remained unanswered (see AnonReviewer2, below). \n\nIn addition, the citation list is rather thin, for example reward shaping has a rich literature, as do incrementally more difficult task setups, dating back at least to Mark Ring\u2019s work in the 1990s. There has also been a lot of complementary work on other FPS games. I\u2019m not asking that the authors do any direct comparisons, but to give the reader a sense of context in which to place this.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}]}
