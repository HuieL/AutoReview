The authors choose to use the framework of guided policy search at the meta-level to train the optimizers. They also opt to train on random objectives and assess transfer to a few simple tasks.\n\nAs pointed below, this is a useful addition.\n\nHowever, the argument of using RL vs gradients at the meta-level that appears below is not clear or convincing. I urge the authors to run an experiment comparing the two approaches and to present comparative results. This is a very important question, and the scalability of this approach could very well hinge on this fact. Indeed, demonstrating both scaling to large domains and transfer to those domains is the key challenge in this domain.\n\nIn summary, the idea is a good one, but the experiments are weak.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "This paper proposes an approach to learning a custom optimizer for a given class optimization problems. I think in the case of training machine learning algorithms, a class would represent a model like \u201clogistic regression\u201d. The authors cleverly cast this as a reinforcement learning problem and use guided policy search to train a neural network to map the current location and history onto a step direction/magnitude. Overall I think this is a great idea and a very nice contribution to the fast growing meta-learning literature. However, I think that there are some aspects that could be touched on to make this a stronger paper.\n\nMy first thought is that the authors claim to train the method to learn the regularities of an entire class of optimization problems, rather than learning to exploit regularities in a given set of tasks. The distinction here is not terribly clear to me. For example, in learning an optimizer for logistic regression, the authors seem to claim that learning on a randomly sampled set of logistic regression problems will allow the model to learn about logistic regression itself. I am not convinced of this, because there is bias in the randomly sampled data itself. From the paper in this case, \u201cThe instances are drawn randomly from two multivariate Gaussians with random means and covariances, with half drawn from each.\u201d It seems the optimizer is then trained to optimize instances of logistic regression *given this specific family of training inputs* and not logistic regression problems in general. A simple experiment to prove the method works more generally would be to repeat the existing experiments, but where the test instances are drawn from a completely different distribution. It would be even more interesting to see how this changes as the test distribution deviates further from the training distribution.\n\nCan the authors comment on the choice of architecture used here? Why one layer with 50 hidden units and softplus activations specifically? Why not e.g., 100 units, 2 layers and ReLUs?\nPresumably this is to prevent overfitting, but given the limited capacity of the network, how do these results look when the dimensionality of the input space increases beyond 2 or 3?\n\nI would love to see what kind of policy the network learns on e.g., a 2D function using a contour plot. What do the steps look like on a random problem instance when compared to other hand-engineered optimizers?\n\nOverall I think this a really interesting paper with a great methodological contribution. My main concern is that the results may be oversold as the problems are still relatively simple and constrained. However, if the authors can demonstrate that this approach produces robust policies for a very general set of problems then that would be truly spectacular.\n\nMinor notes below.\n\nSection 3.1 should you be using \\pi_T^* to denote the optimal policy? You use \\pi_t^* and \\pi^* currently.\n\nAre the problems here considered noiseless? That is, is the state transition given an action deterministic? It would be very interesting to see this on noisy problems.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}]}
