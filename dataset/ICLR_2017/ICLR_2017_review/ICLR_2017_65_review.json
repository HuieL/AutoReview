The authors also evaluate NVI on a different model ProdLDA (not sure this model has been proposed before in the topic modeling literature though?)\n\nIn general, I like the direction of this paper and NVI looks promising for LDA. The experimental results however confound model vs inference which makes it hard to understand the significance of the results. Furthermore, the authors don't discuss hyper-parameter selection which is known to significantly impact performance of topic models. This makes it hard to understand when the proposed method can be expected to work. \n\nCan you maybe generate synthetic datasets with different Dirichlet distributions and assess when the proposed method recovers the true parameters?\n\nFigure 1: Is this prior or posterior? The text talks about sparsity whereas the y-axis reads \"log p(topic proportions)\" which is a bit confusing.\n\nSection 3.2: it is not clear what you mean by unimodal in softmax basis. Consider a Dirichlet on K-dimensional simplex with concentration parameter alpha/K where alpha<1 makes it multimodal. Isn't the softmax basis still multimodal?\n\nNone of the numbers include error bars. Are the results statistically significant?\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\nLast term in equation (3) is not \"error\"; reconstruction accuracy or negative reconstruction error perhaps?\n\nThe idea of using an inference network is much older, cf.

The paper shows a nice trick to approximate Dirichlet prior using softmax basis with a Gaussian and then the model is trained to maximize the variational lower bound. Also, the authors study a better way to alleviate the component collapsing issue, which has been problematic for continuous latent variables that follow Gaussian distribution. The results look promising and the experimental protocol sounds fine.\n\nMinor comments:\nPlease add citation to [1] or [2] for neural variational inference, and [2] for VAE. \nA typo in \u201cThis approximation to the Dirichlet prior p(\u03b8|\u03b1) is results in the distribution\u201d, it should be \u201cThis approximation to the Dirichlet prior p(\u03b8|\u03b1) results in the distribution\u201d\n\nIn table 2, it is written that DMFVI was trained more than 24hrs but failed to deliver any result, but why not wait until the end and report the numbers?\n\nIn table 3, why are the perplexities of LDA-Collapsed Gibbs and NVDM are lower while the proposed models (ProdLDA) generates more coherent topics? What is your intuition on this?\n\nHow does the training speed (until the convergence) differs by using different learning-rate and momentum scheduling approaches shown as in figure 1?\n\nIt may be also interesting to add some more analysis on the latent variables z (component collapsing and etc., although your results indirectly show that the learning-rate and momentum scheduling trick removes this issue).\n\nOverall, the paper clearly proposes its main idea, explain why it is good to use NVI, and its experimental results support the original claim. It explains well what are the challenges and demonstrate their solutions. \n\n[1] Minh et al., Neural Variational Inference and Learning in Belief Networks, ICML\u201914\n[2] Rezende et al., Stochastic Backpropagation and Approximate Inference in Deep Generative Models, ICML\u201914", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, {"review": "This is an interesting paper on a VAE framework for topic models. The main idea is to train a recognition model for the inference phase which, because of so called \u201camortized inference\u201d can be much faster than normal inference where inference must be run iteratively for every document. Some comments:\nEqn 5: I find the notation p(theta(h)|alpha) awkward. Why not P(h|alpha) ?\nThe generative model seems agnostic to document length, meaning that the latent variables only generate probabilities over word space. However, the recognition model is happy to radically change the probabilities q(z|x) if the document length changes because the input to q changes. This seems undesirable. Maybe they should normalize the input to the recognition network?\nThe ProdLDA model might well be equivalent to exponential family PCA or some variant thereof: http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v9/li10b/li10b.pdf\nSection 4.1: error in the equation. The last term should be \nProd_i exp(delta*_r_i) * exp((1-delta)*s_i).\nLast paragraph 4.1. The increment relative to NVDM seems small: approximating the Dirichlet with a Gaussian and high momentum training. While these aspects may be important in practice they are somewhat incremental.\nI couldn\u2019t find the size of the vocabularies of the datasets in the paper. Does this method work well for very high dimensional sparse document representations?\nThe comment on page 8 that the method is very sensitive to optimization tricks like very high momentum in ADAM and batch normalization is a bit worrying to me. \nIn the end, it\u2019s a useful paper to read, but it\u2019s not going to be the highlight of the conference.
